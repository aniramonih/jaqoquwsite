Both admirers and critics are shocked by this drastic weight loss. Exactly how much weight he has lost? He has not revealed the exact figure.</p><p>Vince Wilfork has officially been inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame on Saturday. On the preceding event on Thursday night, dressed in a red blazer, he shared an amusing anecdote about how <strong>Bill Belichick</strong>, the head coach of the New England Patriots was stunned by his physical transformation and had a strong <a href=# rel=noopener>reaction</a> to his new look after weight loss.</p><p>In the event, Vince Wilfork recounted to the reporters the funny story about the time he bumped into the legendary Patriots coach in Miami last year.<br>He <a href=# rel=noopener>stated</a>:</p><p><strong>Bill was being Bill. He was on his treadmill working out, and I was like, 'I want to go see Coach, He's on the treadmill working out, and I come in and he's like, 'What the f---?' What?? And I'm trying to talk to him, and the only thing he [could] say was, 'Oh my gosh, you look good! You look like you can still play,' And I was like, 'Okay Coach, listen, I just came to see you.' He couldn't stop saying how good I looked and everything.</strong></p><p>In his 13-season NFL career, of which 11 were spent with New England, Vince Wilfork was reported as weighing <a href=# rel=noopener>325 pounds</a>, according to Pro Football Reference. Despite being heavyweight, he had a 40-yard dash time of 5.08 seconds.</p><p>Speaking of his weight loss during the event on Thursday, he also shared with the reporters that he had slimmed down as a result of focusing on living a healthy lifestyle and leading a stress-free life after retirement. Additionally, the two-time Super Bowl champion stated he still finds it difficult to comprehend the honor as he gets ready for his induction into the Patriots Hall of Fame. During an interview with the reporters, he stated that:</p><p><strong>Never once when I played I thought about being where I'm at, honestly,I just love football, that's how I approached every day, to be the best teammate I possibly could be and be consistent.</strong></p><p>Vince Wilfork was a pillar of New England's defense and won two Super Bowls with the Patriots during his career. He was also selected for five Pro Bowls and he used to be one of the heaviest NFL players. But now, Wilfork is still in excellent shape after his weight loss journey. However, he is not tempted to come out of his retirement simply because he is much fitter now and he made sure to note that Belichick was unable to persuade him to play in the NFL well into his forties like his former teammate <strong>Tom Brady </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@tombrady</a>).</p><p>Vince Wilfork's internet followers are pleased with his weight loss and excited about the future of his happy and healthy lifestyle. After retirement, the majority of professional athletes neglect their health, which leads to a variety of health problems and weight gain that worsens the situation. Additionally, a lot of athletes continue to have poor eating habits after they stop competing, which hinders them in weight loss.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGitoqaTmnq4tcufpqujXayyqrPHrWSlp6OofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
