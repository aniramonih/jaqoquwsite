She began to speak openly with the police, admitting she believed Georgina Misener, her love’s ex-wife, might be to blame.</p><p>However, even though it appeared that Georgina, who resides in Tuscon, was at home when the shooting occurred, the fact that she was engaged in a custody dispute with Matthew created some questions.</p><p>That is how Eduardo Montano Jr. was found and apprehended by the police, only for a subsequent search of his residence to turn up the murder weapon with 14 missing rounds.</p><p>The Tucson resident initially denied any involvement in the incident. Still, it soon became apparent that he had lied about practically everything, including his employment, <a href=#>relationship</a> with Matthew, and other details.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Where Are The Killers Now?</strong></h2><p>While Georgina was detained on February 25 on suspicion of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, Eduardo was arrested on February 12, 2020.</p><p>However, they didn’t appear in court until later in the year; on September 9, 2021; the former entered a plea of guilty to second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit aggravated assault.</p><p>On November 13, Georgina entered a guilty plea to the exact charges. She and Eduardo received consecutive prison terms of 3334 years, divided between 25 years for murder and 834 years for conspiracy. As a result, they have currently incarcerated in Arizona state-run prisons, serving their terms.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC5wK2roZ2nYrqqv8SnnKtlnaq%2FpbHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
