He’s appeared in all sorts of classic films like I, Robot, as well as massively popular television shows like Mad Men. But in what roles did he show the very best of his talent? Read on to find out the 10 best Bruce Greenwood movies and TV shows!</p>Recommended Videos<h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=h-elephant-song data-injectable=false>Elephant Song</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=426 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>This tense psychological thriller sees Greenwood take on the role of a psychiatrist who discovers that a severely ill patient may hold the key to finding a missing colleague. As the film unfolds, this mental game of cat and mouse reaches a disturbing climax, with all of the complex emotions at play shown wonderfully in Greenwood’s excellent performance. He is undoubtedly the highlight of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an already captivating film</a>.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>John From Cincinnati</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=406 data-current-count=706 data-injectable=true>Greenwood stars as a surfing purist and surf shop owner, Mitch Yost, in this short-lived oceanside HBO drama. Although it only ran for one season, the series was noted for its unique take on all kinds of topics, as well as the intriguing way it wove fantastical elements into an otherwise normal setting. Greenwood is excellent as Yost, making the audience root for what is objectively a prickly character.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>Being Julia</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=467 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>Although Greenwood is only a supporting character in this adaptation of Theatre by W. Somerset Maugham, he is fantastic in his limited screentime as Lord Charles. His character is the former lover of the eponymous Julia, and eventually ends up becoming close friends with her after he reveals he’s gay. A funny, smart film that’s made all the better by its sterling performances, including Greenwood’s. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Die Hard fan favorite</a> Jeremy Irons also stars.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>Star Trek</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=429 data-current-count=729 data-injectable=true>When J.J Abrams was given the chance to get his hands on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">iconic IP that is Star Trek</a>, many trekkies were pretty happy with the choice, and their optimism was proven correct. Star Trek (2009) is one of the best reboots in the sci-fi world, and part of that is thanks to Greenwood’s excellent performance as captain of the Enterprise Christopher Pike. He does a truly fantastic job of embodying such an iconic character.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>The Sweet Hereafter</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>This emotionally devestating movie follows the aftermath of a tragic school bus accident in which fourteen kids are killed. The traumatic event further deepens divisions in the town, sometimes even between family members. Greenwood plays a grieving parent and is magnetic, really making you feel his pain. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Women Talking director Sarah Polley</a> also stars alongside him.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>St. Elsewhere</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=456 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>Greenwood was a fan favorite as Dr Seth Griffin on this iconic American medical drama series. Although it never gained a massive following, the gritty show developed the sort of devoted fanbase that nowadays would have probably earned it an extra couple of seasons from online fan pressure. Griffin was only on the show for seasons 5 and 6, but managed to be one of the best performers in a talented ensemble cast that includes big names like Ed Begley Jr.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>Thirteen Days</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=402 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>Canadian veteran Greenwood took on the role of one of the most iconic American presidents of all time in this film that dramatizes the events around the Cuban Missile Crisis, from the perspective of the U.S. government. Although it’s a tense watch, the pacing never feels off, and Greenwood does such an excellent job as Kennedy that he earned himself a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>The Resident</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Greenwood’s most recent consistent television role saw him dive back to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">world of medical dramas</a> in The Resident. He plays the part of the hospitals chief of surgery (and later CEO) Randolph Bell, and is fantastic as this complex and occasionally morally dubious character, showcasing just why he’s had such a long and successful career.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>Mad Men</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=378 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>This legendary show about the world of advertising in the mid-20th century was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">critically acclaimed and ultra-popular</a>, and Greenwood lived up to all that hype during his guest appearances in the final season as Richard Burghoff. His character is a wealthy real estate mogul who gets involved with Joan, with pretty sad consequences for the former Sterling Cooper office manager.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>Gerald’s Game</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=306 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=false>Greenwood is utterly brilliant as the eponymous Gerald in this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen King adaptation</a> on Netflix. Although his co-star Carla Gugino is the real star of the show, he is an excellent foil as the angry husband (and later ghostly apparition) that taunts and haunts her character. A tense but unmissable watch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZeytMCMm6mum5VitLOxxKeuqKeUYrqwwsieqmaZnpl6tcKMrJ%2Bor6Nk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
