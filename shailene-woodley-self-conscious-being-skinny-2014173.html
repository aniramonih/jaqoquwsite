“My whole life I’ve been so self-conscious about being skinny. And just recently I don’t care anymore,” Woodley told the magazine. “All insecurities are projected because of what you think others are saying about you, but they don’t really matter at all."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In the April issue of Marie Claire, the Divergent actress opens about how she recently overcame being self-conscious about her body, and is putting her teenage years in the past.</p><p>“My whole life I’ve been so self-conscious about being skinny. And just recently I don’t care anymore,” Woodley told the magazine. “All insecurities are projected because of what you think others are saying about you, but they don’t really matter at all. My only real insecurities in high school were having such long legs and thick hair — things I’m so very grateful for now.”</p><p>The Secret Life of the American Teenager star is also a little self-conscious about the age she was when she shared her first kiss. “I was the latest bloomer there ever was. I was still playing with Barbies at 14 and didn’t have my first kiss until 15-and-a-half,” she revealed. “He had big, beautiful lips, and I was like, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do with those.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Now, the 22-year-old actress feels like she is coming into her own. “For the first time, I feel like I’m entering my womanhood,” Woodley said. “I’ve decided to take a few months off, just to see who I am as that woman in the world, because I’ve never been able to experience it outside of this industry.”</p><p>While on her journey of self-discovery, Woodley seems content to stay single. “I just haven’t met anyone where I was like, ‘Wow I could definitely see myself spending a season of my life with you,'” she explained. “I don’t even know if humans are genetically made to be with one person forever.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But there is one man in her life that wouldn’t mind spending time with: <strong>George Clooney</strong>.</p><p>“He’s still one of my favorite human beings,” Woodley said of the 52-year-old actor who played her father in 2011’s The Descendants. “The things he talks about in the press, like going to Africa, are about one-thirtieth of the things he does. My mom and George are probably the only two people I’ve ever met who are truly genuine givers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGeuaa6xGauqKeUobK6edKeo59lk6S7tK%2FIqKysZZKatq%2BzjKyioqaernpzfJBtaHBrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
