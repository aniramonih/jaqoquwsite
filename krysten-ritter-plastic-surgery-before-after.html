She first made an uncredited appearance in the movie Someone Like You in 2001. Two years later, she got an acting gig as one of Julia Roberts’ students in Mona Lisa Smile. She next got a recurring part in the soap opera One Life to Live in 2004.

Afterwards, she also busied herself playing small to supporting roles in such films as 27 Dresses, What Happens in Vegas, and played the lead character’s best friend in the romantic comedies <a href=# rel=nofollow>Confessions of a Shopaholic</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow>She’s Out of My League</a>.

Prior to this, she was also prolific on both her movie and television career. With her remarkable physical appeal and amazing acting chops, it’s no wonder that she’d be given a major opportunity to prove herself. As her name becomes more mainstream, she attracts the curious eyes of those various observers, wondering if the actress has done anything plastic surgery-related.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>What makes some people suspect her of undergoing a cosmetic procedure is because of her seemingly-perfectly slim nose, which compliments her other facial features really greatly. However, her nose doesn’t actually look fake, it just looks slim, which makes her very lucky for having such a feature. Standing at 5’9, Ritter’s physical features are just proportional with her height, so there’s nothing to speculate about. Her breasts are of average size and look natural, too. Thus far, everything about the Jessica Jones star is plastic surgery-free.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h3 class=related_post_title>Related Posts</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwKrGxKxlnKedZLizxdKtnKdlop7BtbHRZqelmaOptqR50q6poJ2irnqjscWoqZ5lkZvBpr6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
