The last time DOOL fans saw dead Jordan, she appeared to Ben in an unsettling dream before his wedding to Ciara Brady Weston (Victoria Konefal).</p><p>Ben was tormented by that dream and seemingly hallucinated that he was talking to Jordan – even after he woke up. In other words, it wasn’t a pleasant experience for Ben as he prepared to tie the knot with Ciara.</p><p>It seems likely Ben’s next dream will be another unsettling one – perhaps to rub it in after Ben’s marriage becomes an official failure.</p><p>Days spoilers say Ben will receive divorce papers from Ciara during the week of May 17-21. It’ll be hard for Ben to come to grips with losing his wife and the future they planned.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben will contemplate hopping on a plane and trying to change Ciara’s mind in South Africa</a>, but Claire Brady (Isabel Durant) will change Ben’s mind.</p><p>Ben will let Claire kiss him as he struggles, but he’ll ultimately pull away and continue to dwell on what he’s lost. It’s safe to say Ben will be doing plenty of moping, so Jordan may pop up to reveal she knew Ben would end up alone and miserable.</p><p>Since Ben previously imagined Jordan as a rather sinister version of herself, that’ll probably be the case this time around, too.</p><p>Whatever the case, Days viewers can expect Jordan Ridgeway’s visit during the week of May 24-28. It’ll be interesting to hear exactly what Jordan wants to tell her brother, though it’ll likely be what Ben’s telling himself in his own mind.</p><p>Of course, we’ll look forward to seeing Chrishell Stause again as well! Stause always does an excellent job when she appears for return stints – no matter how brief. This will indeed be a short popup, but we have no doubt that Stause will deliver an impressive performance as usual.</p><p>Days of Our Lives spoilers say Ben will have to battle more heartache in the coming weeks, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel! Ben and Ciara will reconcile sooner or later, but Ben will have to suffer until the stars finally align again.</p><p>We’ll offer updates as other Days news comes in. Are you looking forward to Chrishell Stause’s return to DOOL as Jordan Ridgeway? CDL will have other sizzling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Days of Our Lives spoilers, news and updates</a> for you, so stop by frequently.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a rel=nofollow href=#>#DAYS</a> 5/17/2021 Weekly Preview<a rel=nofollow href=#>#DOOL</a> Promo <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/Rvwow87RVH</a></p><p>— ⏳ (@DaysPromo1) <a rel=nofollow href=#>May 14, 2021</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWpnlJbGtHnOn2SoraJiuarCxKxkrKifnrmmvtJmmqGqmai1prjLZqqtmaWosm6%2BxK2sq6ajYq60ecmoqZ2ZnmK%2FqrDGnq6asV2Xsq%2B%2FjKygrKyVp3qjrcKkZJ%2BnomKubsLIrKCtZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
