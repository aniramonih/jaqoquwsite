He spent years <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0557339/bio>getting educated</a> at the University of Toronto & Balliol College, Oxford, before joining the Canadian Field Artillery in World War I.</p><p class=dh>During the dreadful war, he served in France and got wounded. His debut on stage was in Siberia in 1918 — a time the American Forces were occupying it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0e0f0933d0e68488b1eac634be4ea013.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Raymond Massey appearing in the Walt Disney Television via Getty Images tv movie "The President's Plane Is Missing." | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>After the war, he returned to Canada to work on the farm implement business; however, the allure of the stage was too much for him to resist.</p><p class=dh>Raymond began his acting career in 1922 when he appeared at the Everyman Theatre, <a class="me a" href=#>London</a> in "In the Zone." His talent spoke for him, and not long after, he signed a five-year contract with Alexander Korda.</p><p class=dh>He lived in London until 1939, when he moved to the US. He starred in several hit movies and series, cementing his role as a talented actor who could thrive anywhere.</p><p class=dh>The modest man, who had such hatred for traveling by sea and plane, passed away from pneumonia complications at 86.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/91595325ee0c27730d54948fcd35c63a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Raymond Massey in publicity portrait for the film "The Woman In The Window," circa 1944. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>GEOFFREY MASSEY</strong></p><p class=dh>Geoffrey is Raymond's eldest child, and he welcomed her with the first woman he married, Peggy Fremantle. They were married for eight years, and Geoffrey was their only child.</p><p class=dh>Geoffrey <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/west-coast-architecture-legend-geoffrey-massey-dies-at-age-96>was born</a> on Oct. 29, 1924, in London, England. His mother, Peggy Fremantle, was the daughter of a British Admiral named Sydney Fremantle.</p><p class=dh>After her relationship with Raymond ended in 1929, Geoffrey never saw his mother again until he was 40 years old. She wanted nothing to do with him, and he did not have much love in reserve for her having been brought up by his father and his second wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b7b7010c645b83210009e13fd19dd7e4.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Raymond Massey in the role of Dr. Gillespie for a publicity handout from the television medical drama, "Dr. Kildare." | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Unlike his father, he grew up to become an architect. Thanks to Artist BC Binning, he got a job at the architectural firm of Thompson, Berwick, and Pratt, where he met Arthur Erickson, whom he befriended.</p><p class=dh>As Arthur Erickson's architectural partner, he helped design local icons like the famous Simon Fraser University and the MacMillan Bloedel Building.</p><p class=dh>He was involved in some political movements and was also one of the early owners, architects, and developers at Whistler in the 1960s. His job brought him into the path of Ruth Killam when she hired him and Erickson to build a house at a spectacular location.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/99afecd9f33ec981544a445c5a589ea2.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>The Massey family get together for a family reunion on 24th November 1964. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>They fell in love.

He married her in 1955.</p><p class=dh>Massey retired from architecture in 1991. The longest-lived of all three kids, he died from pneumonia at the age of 96 in 2020. He is survived by his four children, Eliza, Raymond, Vincent, and Nathaniel.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DANIEL MASSEY</strong></p><p class=dh>Daniel was the second male child of Raymond Massey. He was a sophisticated and versatile actor who performed with ease and was an essential member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theater for many years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/7ac3c110082a4adb9ea4fcafaa1460fa.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Raymond Massey, in a scene from the movie, "Abe Lincoln in Illinois".

He played a variety of roles in "Shakespeare, "Ibsen," and "Chekhov," but he specialized in comedy.</p><p class=dh>His main reason for becoming an actor was revealed in an interview in 1996. It had to do with seeing Ralph Richardson play Falstaff, he said:</p><p class=dh>"I can remember the whole thing photographically, and at the end of it had to be peeled out of my chair. I was only 11, but I still think it was the best piece of theater I've ever seen."</p><p class=dh>Although he was most known for his stage credits, he also worked in films and on television, playing a wide variety of characters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dbc1ccd73cf895899e8b8c935885f8af.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Raymond Massey appearing in the Walt Disney Television via Getty Images tv movie "All My Darling Daughters." | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>He was married thrice in his lifetime, and he had two kids Alice and Paul.

Instead, she was left with the nanny, whom she relied on for emotional support.</p><p class=dh>That resonant solitude made itself known in her work as an actress but only positively. Nevertheless, she is constantly dazzled with her intelligence and acting talent and is best known for her award-winning works in TV and film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/324803844ae6f621b1a95c8cb7c5297d.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>English actress Anna Massey (1937 - 2011), UK, 8th August 1975. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>She was cast in nannies, nuns, and nurses roles, and she starred in many British and American films, including "The Importance of Being Earnest" and "Possession."</p><p class=dh>She was married twice.
