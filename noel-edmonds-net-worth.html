Edmonds was born on December 22, 1948 in Essex as the son of a headmaster who worked in Hainault, Edmonds.

In 1969, Edmonds moved to BBC Radio 1 where he began recording trailers for broadcasts and filling in for absent DJs. He went on to hatch an extremely successful career in both radio and television and has appeared in more than 15 radio and television shows throughout his lifetime.
