The book chronicles her struggles and triumphs along the way to making it as a professional tennis player.</p><p style=text-align:justify>We mentioned before that the show was supposed to air on HBO Max. The release date of late June 2022 came and went without the show being made available. On July 12th, 2022, however, for no apparent reason, a sole distribution license was issued to Netflix.</p><p style=text-align:justify>It should be noted that All American: Homecoming has only been made available on Netflix in the United States, and that this is likely to be the case going forward. You’ll have to come up with an alternate plan to view the show if you’re not in the US.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is All American: Homecoming Season 2 Canceled?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>No, All American: Homecoming Season 2 isn’t canceled.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Homecoming and <strong><a href=#>its parent show All American</a></strong>, were renewed despite the fact that a significant amount of The CW’s repertoire was cancelled in the current season.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The fifth season of All American has been ordered and will premiere on Netflix in 2023.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Deadline learned in early July 2022 that the second season of All American: Homecoming would premiere in October of that year (specifically October 10th). That’s a bit early than when the first season’s episodes became available.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>When Will All American: Homecoming Arrive to Netflix?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The upcoming season of All American: Homecoming may or may not make its way to Netflix, unlike previous shows from The CW. Unlike past CW titles, Homecoming will not be available on Netflix for as long as it airs on The CW. New seasons are likely to be licensed by Netflix.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><a href=#>All American Season 4 Episode 19 Release Date and Time, Promo, Spoiler, Cast, And Know More</a></strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>If it makes it to Netflix at all, it would have to be after the series concluded on The CW. The 13 episodes are planned to be completed by early Spring of 2023, making their debut on Netflix shortly thereafter.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Due to the lack of confirmed end dates, I can only speculate to the Spring of 2023. Besides, whenever there’s an official update from the showrunner, I’ll make sure to update you on this.
