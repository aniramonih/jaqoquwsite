The ice hockey player brothers do not have any sisters.</p><p>Besides being brothers, the two are rivals of each other & have cemented themselves as key figures in their respective teams.</p><h2>Kailer Yamomoto Injuries</h2><p>Considered one of the high-impact sports, players of the NHL are barely free from injuries, so is for 27-year-old ice hockey star Kailer Yamamoto.</p><p>Yamamoto, the Edmonton Oilers’ right winger, suffered a groin injury in the 2018-19 season that led him to miss eight games. Subsequently, in the 2019 spring, he underwent wrist surgery.</p><p>On February 23, 2020, he sustained an ankle injury during a 4-2 win against the Los Angeles Kings. It kept him away for a week before his return on March 2 & won against the Nashville Predators.</p><p>His two NHL seasons (2020-21 & 2021-22) were also not free of injuries but nothing too serious.</p><p>However, the 2022-23 season has drawn a notable concern about Yamamoto’s injuries, having missed 23 games.</p><p>After missing seven games due to an undisclosed injury during the Oilers’ road trip, Kailer was put on injured reserve on November 27, 2022, before activating him on December 5.</p><p>However, on January 17, 2023, he was again placed in the injured reserve (long-term) option for a minimum of 26 days.</p><p>Kailer Yamamoto returned to the roster on February 17, 2023, in a game against the NY Rangers but lost.</p><p>As of this writing, the NHL player has not sustained any major injuries. Every time, he gets injured, Kailer’s proved his worth upon return- no doubt, “Injury makes the comeback sweeter.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC3xJqlrmWplrqiuc6tpmajkZ65pr6MspimmZ2kwbB5waumraCVp3qiuthmqqKrpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
