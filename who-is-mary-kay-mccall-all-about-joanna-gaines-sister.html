He returned to the U.S. in 1969, and in 1972, the couple tied the knot and has remained married since then.</p><p>Jerry is of German and Lebanese descent, while her mother is Korean. This makes Mary half-Korean and half-German. She attended a neighborhood high school in Waco. She also attended college, but the name of the college she attended and the course she studied has not been revealed to the public.</p><h2><strong>She is the Youngest of Jerry Stevens’ Daughters</strong></h2><p>Mary is the youngest of the Stevens’ daughters; she grew up with her older sisters Joanna and Teresa in Waco, Texas. Teresa is the eldest of the three; Joanna is the middle child and coincidentally, the most famous.</p><p>Teresa is a well-known Christian author, while Joanna is a reality television star and businesswoman. Mary Kay is close to her sisters and even fondly refers to each other by their childhood nicknames. Joanna, for one, is 45 years old and owns her own home renovation company, Magnolia Homes.</p><p>The three sisters all share a love for plants and nature. However, of all three, Mary Kay appears closest to Joanna. In 2018, when Joanna was still on the ‘Fixed Upper show, she helped redesign Mary Kay’s new house before relocating to Waco, Texas.</p><p>They are also working towards hosting a new show together, but this time, with a focus on Mary Kay and her new plant business, Ferny. The two women have much in common—from a combined love of plants to a shared passion for big families.</p><p>They even seemed to be in a playful competition over who has the most children; Mary Kay has six children presently, while Joanna is a mother to 5 children. Mary says that her sister Joanna is very selfless and kind. She once took to social media to thank Joanna for helping her set up her new business, even without asking for help.</p><p>On the other hand, Joanna said that her sister Mary Kay had a wild, free energy and that she doesn’t care much about what others think as long as she’s happy.</p><h2><strong>Mary Kay McCall Runs a Successful Plant Business&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Mary Kay might not be as famous or wealthy as her sister, but she can certainly hold her own regarding her finances. Mary owns a plant business named Ferny. According to the mother-of-6, it was a business she had wanted to start up right from her college days but had to shelve her plans temporarily due to marriage and child raising.</p><p>She eventually launched her business in 2019. She initially wanted to start a coffee shop surrounded by exotic plants but later decided to sell her plants in an antique pop-up van.</p><p>As of 2022, Mary Kay is estimated to have a personal net worth of $2 million. This is a far cry from that of her sister’s net worth, reported to amount to a total of $40 million; however, it is something to be proud of.</p><h2><strong>She is Married to David McCall</strong></h2><p>Mary Kay is currently married to David McCall. The lovely couple has been together for over 18 years and counting. David is a medical doctor and surgeon from Waco, Texas. He bagged his Master of Science Education Medical (MSED) and Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degrees from ATSU-SOMA.</p><p>Although there isn’t much information on how Mary and David met, they married while they were still college students and barely in their twenties. In 2021, Mary Kay McCallon took to her @fernysretroplantshop Instagram page to celebrate her 17th anniversary with David. They seem to be quite content in their marriage, and there has been no scandal concerning their marriage till this present moment.</p><p>The couple has six beautiful children: five daughters and one son. Their last baby was born in 2019. Still, to maintain the McCall family culture of privacy, all six kids’ names and ages have been kept from public view.</p><p>Their eldest child, however, is about 17 years old, while the youngest is three years old. They all live together in their beautiful family mansion in Waco, Texas. You can catch glimpses of the McCall kids from Mary’s personal Instagram, @mikeymccall. Her personal Instagram account is private; you will need to send a request to be let in; however, you can also catch up with her on her business account @fernysretroplantshop.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmalkafGbrfAsmSmm5OWua15wKWjZpmSpMK1ecmomKemkWK0orXNnqpmq5mowaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
