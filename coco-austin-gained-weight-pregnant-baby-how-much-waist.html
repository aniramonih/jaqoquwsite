She told her Instagram followers in the caption that,”I gained 13 pounds my whole pregnancy and now I weigh almost back to norm at 137 pounds.” That’s shocking as the baby alone weighed in at almost 6 pounds when she was born!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“All this is strange to me too, how my body took so well with pregnancy because I was mentally prepared to blow up like a whale and I was totally cool with it I really could have cared less how my body looked, it didn’t matter to me. I couldn’t wait to get a bump and rock it! I would’ve gone through anything to make a healthy baby. I had the heavens really watching over me and know everyday how blessed I am.” Pick up Ice Loves Coco season 3 here.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>She claims she went on a pre-baby diet, noting “I lost 10 pounds before I even started to gain baby weight probably because I stopped drinking alcohol. And I stopped weight lifting and lost a lot of muscle.” Coco goes on to claim “I ate really healthy and took my vitamins everyday.” &nbsp;Um, okay…but we’re sure most other pregnant women do the same.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>This can’t sit well with other celebs who – like most normal women – put on extra weight while pregnant. That would most definitely include <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kim Kardashian</a></strong>, 35, who admitted she put on 60 pounds and can’t understand how some stars get their post-baby bodies back so quickly. She even blogged, “I look at other celebrities and Instagram girls who are literally so skinny right after giving birth. How is that possible?!?!. “F***, I hope people don’t expect that from me, LOL!”” just one day before giving birth to son <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Saint West</a></strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are you shocked Coco only gained 13 pounds while pregnant?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH5ze49wZpynk6R6osHSraCnZZeWtq%2Bxw2aunqGXncFuvNGenqeZnql6o63BsmShp6diuravx2aumqGjqXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
