The singer had gotten very skinny after she lost 60 pounds, which was her baby weight with an extra 10 pounds, but she looks as though she has gained some of it back. If Meghan Trainor indeed had weight gain, she has yet to reveal it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Meghan Trainor</strong></a> rose to popularity in 2014 when she released her debut single All About That Bass which became an instant hit. Women went gaga over the fact that someone had come up with a song that celebrated curvy and full bodies instead of the standardized skinny bodies. Trainor was appreciated for the message she conveyed through her song. Most of <a href=#><strong>her songs</strong></a> have the themes of body image, womanhood, and personal empowerment, and she garnered a lot of female fans because she was very relatable to them as someone struggling with her body image.</p><p>Meghan Trainor has once again become the subject of discussion about her body image. This time, it's about her weight and the fact that she may have had a weight gain. Just a year ago, she lost about 60 pounds after she had her baby and got skinnier than she ever was. Now, that seems to have changed and fans want to know if she has not been keeping off her weight. It looks like it's annoying for Trainor to have to deal with fans' curiosity but it is what it is.</p><p data-pf_style_display=block data-pf_style_visibility=visible>You might also like the <strong data-pf_style_display=inline data-pf_style_visibility=visible><a href=# data-pf_style_display=inline data-pf_style_visibility=visible>weight gain</a>&nbsp;</strong>stories of <a href=#><strong>Fat furs</strong></a> and <a href=# data-pf_style_display=inline data-pf_style_visibility=visible><strong data-pf_style_display=inline data-pf_style_visibility=visible>Chrissy Metz</strong></a>.</p><h2>Meghan Trainor's Weight Gain: Did She Put on The Weight She Lost After Her Pregnancy?</h2><p><strong>Meghan Trainor</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@meghantrainor</a>) appears to have undergone a weight gain after losing <strong>60 pounds</strong> about a year ago.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/12/meghan-trainor-pic1.jpg alt="Meghan Trainor may have had a weight gain since the time she lost 60 pounds. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Meghan Trainor may have had a weight gain since the time she lost 60 pounds.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: The Hollywood Reporter</strong></p><p>Trainor recently teamed up with <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> for a new Christmas duet called Wrap Me Up and <a href=# rel=noopener>performed the song</a> on Jimmy Kimmel Live. The pair were very lively and joyful during their performance and not to mention, they looked very incredible. Especially, Meghan Trainor who looked very Christmas-y with her ultra-festive bright red dress which had photos of her sons over it along with Christmas trees, hearts, and snowflakes. Jimmy also looked great in that red velvet suit but it was Meghan who stole the limelight, not just because of what she wore, but also because of how she looked in what she wore. There was a rise in speculations of her weight gain after that performance.</p><p>The speculations continued to rise after Meghan Trainor and Jimmy Fallon made an appearance on Today to <a href=# rel=noopener>talk about their holiday hit</a> because she was looking very big compared to how she did about a year ago when she had lost 60 pounds. Dressed in that baggy sweatshirt, she didn't look anything like the skinny woman she was a year ago. Oh, by the way, when she <a href=# rel=noopener>lost 60 pounds</a>, it was a huge change because she got thinner than she had ever been. So, now that she does not look that way, people are wondering if she had weight gain again.</p><p>Speaking of her weight loss journey, in an interview with ET Canada, Trainor said that she was at her heaviest when she gave birth to her son <strong>Riley</strong> in 2021. She was over 200 pounds and she was not in a great state of mind with how much she weighed. But thinking about having to be there for her son motivated her to do something about her weight and she <a href=# rel=noopener>embarked on a fitness journey</a>. Since then, she seems to have had a weight gain.</p><h2>Meghan Trainor May Not Want to Talk About Her Weight Gain!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/12/meghan-trainor-pic2-1.jpg alt="Meghan Trainor was 200 pounds at her heaviest about a year ago when she had a baby. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Meghan Trainor was 200 pounds at her heaviest about a year ago when she had a baby.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Cosmopolitan&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Now, <strong>Meghan</strong> <strong>Trainor</strong> does not look like how she looked when she had been successful in shedding off her pregnancy weight.</p><p><strong>I was my heaviest I've ever been. I was 200 lbs...I just wasn’t feeling great. I’ve never had stitches, so to have this C-section scar go across the stretch marks, I was in a really dark place, and I wanted to be in a great place for my son. So, I worked every day and challenged myself. I was like, ‘If I can survive a C-section, I can do anything!’ And I did. I was very dedicated, and I started seeing the pounds come off like one week at a time one pound. I learned that I do like healthy food, and I learned what portions mean. And I learned my brain is so happy when I exercise, so I’m just [feeling] better than ever.</strong></p><p>It's possible that Meghan Trainor has not had a weight gain and it's just the kind of outfits she wore that made her appear bigger than she was. In her Today appearance, she was wearing that baggy sweatshirt that certainly did no wonder for her figure, and during her performance as well, her outfit looked kind of ill-fitted on her. There's not much difference in her face compared to before and if she indeed had a weight gain, would that not show on her face?</p><p>Anyway, these are just speculations but the All About That Bass hitmaker, as someone who grew up chubby and is naturally not slender, may not want to talk about her weight if she gained weight because she had gotten incredibly skinny when she lost 60 pounds with a lot of effort. If she has indeed gotten bigger, it must be because she relaxed about her fitness and stopped going hardcore with her exercises which means that she must have realized that if she wants to stay skinny, she is going to have no time for relaxation. As such, Meghan Trainor may not want to talk about her weight gain. Again, it's just a speculation and she might be addressing these anytime soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiknp%2BYlrtuwNGaoKenomLEprXGoatmn5Geu3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
