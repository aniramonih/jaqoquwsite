But the big question is how much would the club have to spend to keep Ronaldo happy?</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-263364 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-988881342.jpg alt width=900 height=610 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-263364 class=wp-caption-text>Francois Nel/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Under his most recent deal, Ronaldo made about $60 million per year. His biggest rival, <a href=# rel=noopener>Lionel Messi</a>, receives about $80 million from Barcelona. Ronaldo would likely demand at least as much as Messi, perhaps slightly more.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Paying Ronaldo would require some exorbitant spending from Juventus. Let's assume a transfer fee of $120 million for a four-year contract. If that happens, Ronaldo, who would be 37 by the time that deal ends, would cost Juventus in the neighborhood of <strong>$440 million</strong>. That's not even accounting for any amortization charges or additional fees.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Ronaldo joins Juventus, the club's salary costs would increase by 40 percent. Ronaldo would earn 12 times the current average wage for Juventus players.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Juventus already regularly sells out its matches, and even with Ronaldo onboard, an increase in TV revenue probably wouldn't happen. In order to handle Ronaldo's high salary, Juventus would likely have to sell multiple players.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meanwhile, Real Madrid won't rest on its laurels for long. The club has done a great job finding players with global appeal and will continue that strategy. Neymard, <a href=# title="Kylian Mbappé Net Worth">Kylian Mbappe</a> and <a href=# title="Harry Kane Net Worth">Harry Kane</a> are all potential players that could take Ronaldo's place.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's going to be strange seeing Ronaldo in a new uniform next season. But that uniform comes with a dollar amount that Real Madrid just wasn't willing to pay.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjpypoquknq6vu4yrpqeZnJm8bq3CrayapJyueq2xwK%2Bgp59dp7KiuIymmJ2qmZl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
