His compensation essentially doubled in 2020 compared to 2019.

He worked to reduce the company's debt and improve its sales and EPS. In 2018, Ellison left JCPenney to become the chief executive at Lowe's, where he remains today.</p><p>Ellison started his tenure at Lowe's by spending the first week visiting stores and speaking with the hourly employees to get a sense of the company culture and needs, RetailDive reported in early 2019.</p><p>Ellison said in that interview, "The way you can reset culture is have clarity of mission, understanding of how to get there and measure — reward great work and make sure there is accountability."</p><p>Lowe's also partnered with <a href=#>Shark Tank's</a> Daymond John in July for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Making It...With Lowe's</a>.
