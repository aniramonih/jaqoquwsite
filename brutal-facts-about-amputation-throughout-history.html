After close inspection, researchers realized the skeleton was missing the lower third of the leg, which had been amputated using a clean cut. Because of the obvious healing of the bone, scientists also estimate the amputation had occurred at least six years before death, during childhood.</p><p>Before this finding, the oldest amputation on record was "just" 7,000 years old and belonged to a Neolithic male found in France, according to a 2007 report published in <a href=#>Nature.</a> Here too, scientists suspected a surgical amputation of the lower leg many years before death. In the book <a href=#>"The Rehabilitation of the Amputee,"</a>&nbsp;Dr. Lawrence W. Friedmann looks at amputations in ancient cultures, including ancient Peruvian civilizations, the <a href=#>Inuit</a> people, and the Dama tribe in Africa — all of which seem to have performed amputations in an effort to save somebody's life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kG5raWpnZK%2BzwdOao2aekZjBtHnAm6aurF2WurHB05qroqeeYsGpvs6unqGnpal6qbXSraarsV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
