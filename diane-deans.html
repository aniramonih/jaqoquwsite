She received the support of the sitting MPP Richard Patten. On June 4, 2007, she lost the provincial nomination to <a href=#>Yasir Naqvi</a>.</p><p>Deans sought the federal Liberal nomination in the riding of Ottawa South in 2004. She lost to <a href=#>David McGuinty</a>. She was seen as a possible candidate to challenge Chiarelli for the mayoralty in 2006, but chose to run for re-election in Gloucester-Southgate Ward.</p><p>Deans considers herself a centrist member of council but traditionally takes a liberal stance on most issues. In the mid-2000s, Deans' main concern had been the creation of a new branch for the Ottawa Public Library in her rapidly growing ward, now called the Greenboro Library. She also supported by-laws limiting smoking in the city, while not supporting a lawn pesticide bylaw in 2002 and 2005. She has engaged in public clashes with Mayor Bob Chiarelli while advocating for her ward.</p><p>Deans was first elected to Ottawa city council in 1994. Prior to Ottawa and its surrounding municipalities were amalgamated in 2001, she faced a tough election against <a href=#>George Barrett</a>. In the 2003 Ottawa election, she handily defeated two lesser-known opponents. After victory in the 2006 Ottawa election, Deans began her fifth term as Councillor for Gloucester-Southgate ward. In the 2010 election, Deans was re-elected in her Gloucester-Southgate Ward. She was once again re-elected in 2014 for her seventh consecutive term.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfmbaiusRmm56Znqg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
