Introduction Plant-based milk is a big thing.
It’s so big—and growing in popularity so fast—that plant-based dairy is forecast to be worth $42.8 billion dollars by 2029.
Right now, it makes up a pretty impressive 10% of the global milk market, with soy milk and almond milk dominating the dairy-free competition at around 40% each.
The world is fast learning the benefits of switching away from dairy—benefits like a reduced impact on the environment, eliminating harm to dairy animals, less land and water usage, etc."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Effectively, this puts their valuation of Numilk at $20 million.</p><p>Remember how the company raised $12 million from angel investors?</p><p>As it turned out, this didn’t generate the kind of profits anyone had expected.</p><p>In 2018, Numilk generated slightly over $40k in sales.</p><p>The following year, it generated an impressive $320k in sales.</p><p>And in 2020, it generated $400k in sales. However, over the three financial periods, the company lost $7 million—predominantly do high research and development expenses.</p><p>While the rest of the Sharks’ panel was out, Mark Cuban had an offer the boys couldn’t refuse: $2 million.</p><p>$1 million would be for a 7% stake in the company, and $1 million would be a loan at 3% interest + an additional 3% equity or advisory shares.</p><p>Effectively, if the pair didn’t take the loan, it was $1 million for 7% equity.</p><p>If they took the loan, it was $2 million for 10% equity.</p><p>The deal was accepted.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Kesha Beachy Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Numilk – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Numilk worth?</p><p>Numilk entered into negotiations with upmarket supermarket chain Whole Foods in 2021, and also launched a Kickstarter campaign.</p><p>The campaign raised an additional $220,000.</p><p>Numilk’s kiosks are used at 65 stores across the United States, with their commercial countertop machines in use at an estimated 150 coffee shops and cafes.</p><p>The company also reached an agreement with Hamilton Beach to manufacture their Home and Pro machines in September of 2022.</p><p>Their home countertop machines have not yet been released to the public, but are available for pre-order through the company’s official website and marketed as a One Press Wonder.</p><p>In 2023, Numilk and Hamilton Beach Brands entered a multiyear agreement.</p><p>Therefore, Numilk has an estimated net worth of $25 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Mario Kiezi’s wife</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfo8KutcukZKedpGLEsL7ToWSsoJGnuG7AwKeiaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
