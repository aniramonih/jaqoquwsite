This means that Brooke will no longer be required to submit to random drug testing, although staff from the Department of Child and Family Services will sort-of check in on her. They’re not going to visit her unannounced, though. This is a recipe for disaster. Those poor kids. Here’s more on this story:</p><p>Nearly a year after Mueller lost custody of Charlie Sheen‘s twin sons, Bob and Max, RadarOnline.com has learned that the former crackhead has been granted full custody of the boys, and won’t be required to undergo further random drug tests!</p><p>“Brooke was recently granted full custody of Bob and Max by a child dependency judge after it was deemed that she had complied with all of the terms set forth by the Los Angeles County Department of Children & Family Services,” an insider tells Radar.</p><p>What’s more, the source adds, “Moving forward, Brooke won’t have to undergo random drug tests. DCFS will keep in contact with Brooke and check up on the boys, but there will be no unannounced visits. As far as Child Protective Services is concerned, Brooke has made a successful recovery, and is now ready to be the legal custodial parent for the boys.”</p><p>“Family reunification is always the goal in these types of cases,” the source continues. “Splitting up a family, take children away from either the mother or father, only happens in extreme cases of neglect and abuse.”</p><p>Mueller, 36, lost custody of the twins after being placed on a psychiatric hold last year after a drug overdose. Sheen’s ex-wife, Denise Richards, then became their temporary guardian until she was forced to give them up after witnessing their disturbing behavior and violence towards her three children and family pets.</p><p>Scott Mueller, Brooke’s brother, subsequently became the boys temporary guardian.</p><p><a href=#>[From Radar Online]</a></p><p>All I can think of is the <a href=#>heartbreaking letter than Denise Richards wrote</a> to DCFS saying that she could no longer care for the boys because they were violent, and because Brooke was blocking all of her attempts to get them professional help. In that letter, Denise claimed that Max and Bob were doing well with her, but had regressed after spending time with Brooke. I also remember how Brooke <a href=#>successfully blocked </a>Charlie’s bid to have the boys tested for fetal alcohol syndrome.</p><p>Meanwhile Brooke is playing nice with Charlie and his new pr0n star fiance. Brooke has been <a href=#>cozying up to Charlie’s piece</a>, Brett, and is allegedly “joking” that she’d gladly sleep with Brett, who did lesbian adult movies before getting with Charlie. I don’t want to think about it, but I do know that now that Brooke has full custody she’ll soon regain the $55k a month that Charlie was paying her in child support. I hope I’m wrong about Brooke, I hope she’s sober and has the boys’ best interests in mind, but I look at her history and it’s not promising.</p><p><a href=#><img alt="Brooke Mueller Takes Her Boys On A Hike" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FFN_Mueller_Hike_DMAC_CPR_111513_51263822_edited-1-828x1024.jpg width=600 sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img alt="Brooke Mueller Picks Up Her Boys From School" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FFN_Mueller_Brooke_STOIANOV_111213_51260353_edited-1-768x1024.jpg width=500 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo credit: Getty and FameFlynet</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbG5gZoJ4e8GrpqijlZS6trHLpZyrl6KatKK1zayWnK2jqbylxb6onZirn6PAoMPIrZ%2BYm5iWv621xJiqoZ2Vo6yvu76lpqeflaesqLHTrJadqqWcrLWx0q2qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
