I’ve watched every show closely in Paris and each time feels like it’s the first one. It’s always so special, so of course I was excited specifically for this Resort Replica show being in Miami, my home now.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Genesis Bonilla</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I remember the first time getting invited to a Chanel show.

I remember wearing capri pants so much in the 2000s — my teenage years — and when I saw that look I was like, “Yes, I need to wear it!” It’s a capri black set with ruffled details. I thought it was so cute for Miami and for being at the beach.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Genesis Bonilla</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I paired it with lots of accessories.

My makeup artist Babi&nbsp;Moura&nbsp;and I concentrated on being a winged, smoked liner and very soft, light pink shades on the face and lips.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-was-it-like-getting-ready-this-time-around></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What was it like getting ready this time around?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Genesis Bonilla</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Getting ready this time was a bit different. We still had music on, like usual — all types of music – but it sounds a bit different because we were mostly talking about baby and motherhood. This is my first event since giving birth to Kai, and I had to break for 15 minutes to breastfeed him when he woke up, and then back to glam.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Genesis Bonilla</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, I always drink coffee during glam to give me energy, but since I’m breastfeeding, my coffee has been replaced with tea. So yes, glam felt a little bit different, but it is still so much fun.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-it-like-being-back-in-the-swing-of-things-following-the-birth-of-your-son></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is it like being back in the swing of things following the birth of your son?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Genesis Bonilla</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since this was my first outing as a mother, it felt exciting, but at the same time, I didn’t know what to expect of myself. There was the show and then the after-party, and I kept telling myself, “I’ll only stay at the party if I have the energy" — and I thought that I wouldn’t have the energy. I did stay for some of the after-party, and then I came back home in time to feed Kai again and give him a bath, which felt amazing to be able to do both.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Genesis Bonilla</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Seeing everybody that I hadn’t seen for so long and watching a show, especially Chanel, also felt really good. I had a lot of fun but I have to be honest, I came back home exhausted. And I was just so happy to be back with Kai. I know I will slowly ease into going out to big events like this, but I feel so into motherhood that I felt like I hadn’t done what I did last night in years, which made it super special and so much fun!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-was-it-like-sitting-front-row-at-the-show></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What was it like sitting front row at the show?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Genesis Bonilla</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sitting front row at a show is such an honor, especially with a fashion house that I respect so much and I love so much. It’s a brand that I’ve been working with for so many years. It’s always an honor to sit front row at Chanel. I sat with fellow friends of mine and I noticed that Pharrell was in the cabana in front of ours, which was amazing, because I’m such a big fan of his. He performed that night, as well. There were many cool people around!</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Genesis Bonilla</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-were-there-any-looks-in-particular-youre-loving></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Were there any looks in particular you’re loving?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chanel</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The look that stood out to me the most was the black sheer dress with the CHANEL embellished hot pants with stockings — so, so hot!<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-some-trends-or-pieces-youre-personally-loving-at-the-moment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are some trends or pieces you’re personally loving at the moment?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Genesis Bonilla</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I loved the combination of glamour and sports.

There’s so much going on here, the city has evolved so much, and I’m so happy that I’m living here now. Miami brings me closer to some family on the East Coast and closer to my hometown in Brazil. I’ve been able to work here and do so much in Miami now, especially events, and not having to travel so much is amazing. I feel like the city is just getting better and better, and there’s so much more to happen in Miami.
