The comedian's only child with her husband, advertising executive <strong>Michel</strong> <strong>Stern</strong>, is now 23 years old and a budding filmmaker.

"Feels like yesterday that you arrived ❤️???"</p><p><strong>Courteney Cox </strong>also replied, saying, "Happy Birthday Julian!! ❤️"</p><p>Cox's ex-husband&nbsp;<strong>David Arquette</strong>'s comment is a little more mysterious. He wrote simply "CHEESE AND CRACKERs!!!" under the post. Based on Kudrow's response, it sounds like that's an old inside joke from Julian's childhood. "CHEESE AND CRACKERS!!!" she replied. "Julian's first guffaw courtesy of the wonderful David Arquette!!"</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Kudrow told&nbsp;</a><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>People</a>&nbsp;in 2018 that Julian was welcomed into the&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;family before he was even born, so it's no surprise that he's still so close with his mom's colleagues.</p><p>"The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, 'All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you,'" she explained. "And when I was pregnant, then they would say, 'Have a great show, love you love you—love you, little Julian!' 'Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name."</p><p><strong>For more celebrity news sent right to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><p>It seems that spending his earliest days on the set of a hit sitcom led to Julian being bitten by the showbiz bug. He's currently in film school and just announced a major accomplishment.</p><p>"After a long while of procrastinating and gathering up a bunch of unsigned documents I am proud to say that my junior thesis film Mind Made Up has been selected for the Portland Comedy Festival!!!" <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Julian wrote on Instagram</a> along with a picture of the crew and the film's poster. "Thanks so much @portland.comedy.film.festival for including my really weird film into your festival!"</p><p>"And to everyone who helped me bring this project to life I couldn't be more thankful!" he continued. "This is literally a dream come true and I couldn't be happier!"</p><p>His proud mom was among the first to comment, dropping a simple "Woohooo!" and a clapping emoji.</p><p>His Instagram bio includes <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a link to the full short film</a>, which Julian wrote and directed.</p><p>Back in 2014, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Kudrow told&nbsp;</a><strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Jimmy Kimmel</a>&nbsp;</strong>during an appearance on his show that Julian was not among the many fans of Friends.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>Kimmel asked if Julian, who was 16 at the time, was "old enough" to watch the hit NBC sitcom.</p><p>"He's old enough," Kudrow answered, "but he's old enough to know he's not that interested."</p><p>The host and father pointed out that, in his own experience, kids don't love watching their parents on TV.</p><p>"He loves everybody else," Kudrow laughed, referring to her cast-mates. "I know that."</p><p>Julian has also poked fun at his connection to the show. In <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a short 2019 Instagram video</a>, he walks through the Santa Monica Promenade, stopping conspicuously in front of the storefront for an interactive Friends&nbsp;experience that coincided with the show's 25th anniversary. "And today, we're gonna go somewhere really special and a little personal to me," he says before heading in the opposite direction. "We're goin' to Lids! Come on, guys!"</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The Worst Friends Guest Star Ever, According to the Creators</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmpaGjlnqswcOrprBlo6S7brrEsKpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
