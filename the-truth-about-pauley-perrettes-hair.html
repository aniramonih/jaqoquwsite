&#34;I actually dyed my hair before NCIS.

But I always wanted black hair. I can't remember when I first dyed it black. I was on another TV show, and they dyed it blonde and all of my hair fell out. It was bad. I had really short blonde hair for a while, but as soon as that show was canceled, I was back in black," Perrette said (per <a href=#>Parade</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>Turns out, the regular dyeing took a toll on her scalp health. "[I] started getting a little irritation. I didn't figure out that it was from hair dye because I had been doing it for so long. And then I kind of started associating, and I was like this has something to do with hair dye. I didn't worry about it too much," Perrette said in a 2015 <a href=#>interview with Queen Latifah</a>, adding it was a case of PPD allergy — an acquired allergy in those who have been dyeing their hair for a long time. Now, that's some dedication to a role!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5nboN1e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2lrra4xLJkqZ2ip7K1wMSsZKGZmad8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
