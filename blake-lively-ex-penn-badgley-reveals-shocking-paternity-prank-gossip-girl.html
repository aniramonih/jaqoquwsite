He added: "I don't remember the phrasing but I remember being like… Didn't even think about it for a moment because who in their right mind would think that that's true."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4d1203a26584-gettyimages-80934531.jpg><p id=eiqnkvug2V2 data-wc=40>Though he didn't believe it at first, his team of representatives played the part, and insisted not only that the story wasn't "going away," but that the Aerosmith legend was insistent that he was in fact his long lost child.</p><p id=ereSCkfTUiy data-wc=21><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively jet off with kids for extra special night out abroad — to see Taylor Swift!</a></strong></p><p id=evbmUTkM4aa data-wc=17><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Ryan Reynolds reveals terrifying but hilarious incident in family home that left kid screaming 'bloody murder'</a></p><p id=eEpgD18KWJ_ data-wc=61>Penn continued: "At this point, of course I don't think it's true but it's like, 'How can Steven Tyler believe this?

"I was speechless and my world was rearranging," he said, and even admitted he began wondering whether he should then pursue a career in music, following in the footsteps of his supposed rockstar father.
