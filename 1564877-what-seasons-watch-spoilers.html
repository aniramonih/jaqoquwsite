Season 5</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>Season 5, set in the beautiful Khonin Nuga Valley among the Khentii Mountains in Northern Mongolia, came with new challenges.

Season 8</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>The season was set in Chilko Lake, British Columbia, Canada. It introduced a new set of rules for the contestants that were very restrictive and took much of the fun out of the viewing experience.

After much struggle, the ultimate prize of $500,000 was awarded to Clay Hayes.</p><h3>9. Season 4</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>Season 4 is one of the best seasons of <i>Alone</i> to watch. It came out on 8 June 2017. Unlike other seasons focusing on singular contestants, it involved seven pairs of two <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/quotes-messages/1468315-100-who-questions-a-fun-game-family/ href=#>family members </a>who must find each other and survive together.
