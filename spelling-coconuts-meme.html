According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KnowYourMeme</a>, South African musician Daniel Marven first <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> the cheekily specific sex advice on Valentine's Day — how fitting, right?</p><p>As Marven put it, "Writing 'COCONUT' using your waist is the trick to master women on top!! Thank me later ladies!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So when did the actual sex tip first go viral?</h2><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenyan Post</a>, the spelling coconuts tip made its way to a Kilimani Mums Facebook group in early July. These ladies had some fun cracking wise about coconuts in the comments section, and they weren't the only ones curious about this spelling-related sex tip.</p><p>This rather specific piece of advice quickly made its way to the rest of the world via social media. Naturally, people had questions.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">And when did the spelling coconuts meme really take off?</h2><p>According to KnowYourMeme, the spelling coconuts meme really started gaining traction on July 15 when Twitter by the name of Lex <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a>, "d--k riding tip #1: spell COCONUT with your waist"</p><p>The tweet quickly went viral and has since been re-tweeted over 40,000 times.

But is spelling coconuts a legit sex tip or a joke?&nbsp;</h2><p>It might be a little of both, depending on who you ask. As many people have noted, coconuts is an oddly specific thing to spell with one's hips. Wouldn't spelling oranges or pineapples achieve the same thing? Also, everything in the bedroom is a matter of personal preference...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So should you try spelling coconuts?&nbsp;</h2><p>Only you and your consensual partner can answer that. We're not going to give you a lecture on safe sex, but as with any intimate activity, you do want to know your limits going into things.&nbsp;</p><p>One doctor took to Twitter with a warning for partners considering spelling coconut too quickly. "That's how [a man] ended up in the emergency room with a PENILE FRACTURE," Dr. Chioma Nwakanma <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "Take it easy spelling before you blunder and fracture his penis!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This doctor's warning about spelling coconuts may become a meme in its own right. His tweet is quickly gaining traction, with re-tweeters adding their own cheeky commentary. "All you COCONUT spellers, beware," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> one user. Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">re-tweeted</a> the warning, noting they already "had this lecture on Valentine's Day this year."</p><p>Responsible sex and responsible spelling apparently go hand in and hand... with coconuts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqL2muMuipaBlk6SwsLrUrapmpZWisg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
