Kris Jenner revealed during the Season 4 premiere of “The Kardashians” Thursday that she once blocked her long-time boyfriend Corey Gamble from appearing in the hit Paramount show “Yellowstone.” Jenner, 67, claimed that she forced Gamble, 42, to turn down the role in the Kevin Costner-led series once she learned that the role might contain some romantic scenes.
The revelation came while the matriarch and two of her daughters, Khloé and Kim Kardashian, grabbed dinner with Gamble in Cabo San Luca."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Creator Taylor Sheridan, 53, later commented that he was “disappointed” by the decision.</p><p>“My opinion of Kevin as an actor hasn’t altered. His creation of John Dutton is symbolic and powerful,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “It truncates the closure of his character. It doesn’t alter it, but it truncates it.”</p><p>It was recently reported, however, that Costner’s agents <a href=#>were “basically begging”</a> the co-creator to let Costner back in the show after “The Bodyguard” actor and his ex-wife Christine Baumgartner finally reached a divorce settlement, with Costner giving his ex more money than their prenup dictated.</p><p>According to Puck News, Costner’s reps allegedly managed to arrange a phone call between themselves and Sheridan, who had already written most of the final episodes. He was reportedly willing to rewrite in order to continue John Dutton’s storyline, but Costner’s alleged demands for more money, a reduced shooting schedule and script approval ended the negotiations.</p><p>New episodes of “The Kardashians” air Thursdays on Hulu and Disney+ at 12 a.m. ET.</p><p><a href=#>“Yellowstone” is now airing</a> from the beginning Sundays on CBS at 8:30 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma3BfoL%2Bqv4yjnKemlad6p7vRnJydZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnWWkpHqzscmemq1lqZq5rbvWrKuoppViv7C4xGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
