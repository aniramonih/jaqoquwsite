After being fired from her job as a lab tech at Hastings Research Institute, Elizabeth comes up with a plan to earn money and continue her experiments. She offers her services to male chemists who secretly come to her house and pay her to do their work. Through this new arrangement, Elizabeth learns that Donatti and Boryweitz were working on a DNA project using her research in Calvin's old lab.One of her clients lets it slip that Donatti had access to her research and was using it for their project. This revelation shocks Elizabeth, and she confronts Donatti in his lab with her dog, Six-Thirty, and her baby in tow. Elizabeth sees her research on the walls and accuses Donatti of stealing it. Donatti shamelessly admits to his crime and even expresses pride at having wrongfully won the Ramsen Grant.
