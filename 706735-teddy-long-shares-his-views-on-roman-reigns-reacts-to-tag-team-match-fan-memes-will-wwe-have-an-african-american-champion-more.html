You can listen to the full interview <a href=#>at this link</a> and below are some of the highlights:</p><p>Teddy Long on Internet memes and parodies of him booking Tag Team Matches as Smackdown GM:</p><p>“This had nothing to do with me sitting down thinking about tag team matches. I never went to ask if we were having a tag team match tonight. They just came to me and said you know know what maybe we going to have a tag team match tonight. I always knew that training under Vince (McMahon)I had to do it Vince’s way and that’s very important when you there to do it his way…”</p><p>Teddy Long on his views on Roman Reigns being used:</p><p>“I think they (WWE) are asking him to do too much and they’re expecting too much from him. I mean he’s trying he really is. I think if they could just slow things down a bit … it’s just all up to Roman”</p><p><b><u><a href=#>Read Also: Teddy Long Comments on the Current Ryback – WWE Situation</a></u></b></p><p>Teddy Long on who the EASIEST McMahon was to work with (Vince, Stephanie, Triple H):</p><p>“Vince! Well the reason I would say Vince is because I’ve had the opportunity to work with all 3 of them. One thing about Vince, like I said earlier it’s easier to do it his way to get along with him. You really need to learn everybody’s way. Stephanie was great t work with but she’s a perfectionist so you had to have everything right and you had to be on your game, and there’s nothing wrong with that. ..”</p><p>Teddy Long on if he feels in the next 10yrs WWE will have its first African American WWE Champion:</p><p>“Yes I do, you know Vince is all about the dollar, and one thing I learned while I was there (WWE) is that Vince doesn’t care what color you are he cares about if you can make him the money. That’s how I was able to stay there for 15 years because I learned the game. I do feel you will see an African American champion. It’s like football they give you the ball and it’s up to you to make a touchdown or you fumble. It’s only but so much the WWE can do for you to get you over and the rest is up to yourself…”</p><p>Teddy Long also discussed advice Vince McMahon gave him, how to stay in WWE for a long time, his thoughts on him never managing Harlem Heat, who came up with the White Boy Challenge and much more in this exclusive 35-minute interview on Under the Mat Radio.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwg49vbmxtXamypbDYZqOoppdiwKmt0Z6qZqCZqHq3tcSwqmannmK%2FsLnAp2SrnZmcu7R50Z6YnKyjYsGwedOanmaslZa6brnArZqhZZaWu265xKacrGWnnrmtedawnGagkauybq3NZpifqpmYrq95wKacq6GTlrtur8eapKmhn6N6rrvRng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
