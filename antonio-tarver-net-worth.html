He is a professional boxer, probably best known as a former WBC, WBA, IBF and The Ring magazine light heavyweight champion.</p><p>So just how rich is Antonio Tarver at present?

He went on to win the Gold Medal at the Pan American Games, the US National Amateur Championships and the World Amateur Boxing Championships in 1995, becoming the only fighter to capture the three wins in a single year. He then won a Bronze Medal at 178 pounds in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.</p><p>The following year Antonio made his professional debut, gaining a second-round technical knockout over Joaquin Garcia. He went on to win his first 16 fights, 14 by knockout, before his first loss in 2000 against Eric Harding in an IBF title elimination bout. In 2002 he scored a win over Reggie Johnson in an IBF light-weight eliminator, winning the NABF/USBA light-heavyweight titles. In a rematch against Eric Harding, Tarver avenged his defeat. His net worth was rising.</p><p>His 2003 win over Montel Griffin brought Tarver the vacant WBC/IBF light-heavyweight titles, his first world championship. This was the beginning of the defining rivalry of Tarver’s career – the one with <a href=#>Roy Jones Jr.</a> He lost his WBC title in the first fight against Jones in 2003, however, in the 2004 rematch, Tarver regained his WBC title, and winning the WBA title, which brought the fighter mainstream attention, appearances on various television and radio shows and on the cover of The Ring and KO Magazine, plus the position of a co-host of ESPN’s “Friday Night Fights” for one telecast. He thus became a star, and his net worth was considerably.</p><p>In 2004 Tarver lost to <a href=#>Glen Johnson</a>, however, in their 2005 rematch Tarver regained his light heavyweight championship, followed in 2005 by the third fight against Jones, from which Tarver came out as a winner. The following year he faced his fourth career loss, in a fight against <a href=#>Bernard Hopkins</a> who forced him to pay $250,000 to a charity of Hopkins’ choice, due to a clause in their fight contract.</p><p>A year later, Tarver scored wins over Elvir Muriqi and Danny Santiago. By outclassing Clinton Woods in 2008, he regained his IBF title, however, the same year he lost the title to <a href=#>Chad Dawson</a>, suffered another loss in their 2009 rematch. He returned to the ring in 2010 to beat Nagy Aguilera in heavyweight division, and the following year he faced <a href=#>Danny Green</a> in the cruiser-weight division, scoring another victory and the IBO cruise-weight title.</p><p>Returning to the heavy-weight division, Tarver earned victories over Mike Sheppard in 2013, and Johnathon Banks in 2014. However, in two of his fights, against Lateef Kayode in 2012 and Steve Cunningham in 2015, Tarver tested positive for a banned substance, which changed the originally split draw results of the two fights into ‘no decision, and Tarver was fined $50,000 and suspended six months for the latter case.</p><p>Aside from boxing, Tarver has also served as a boxing analyst for Showtime Championship Boxing program. He starred alongside <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone</a> in the 2006 film “Rocky Balboa”, as a heavyweight world champion Mason ‘The Line’ Dixon, the role which brought Tarver additional fame and considerably added to his wealth.</p><p>When speaking about his personal life, Tarver was married to Denise(1999-2004). He has one daughter from his previous relationship with Toni Rolle. The boxer has been involved in several controversies. In 2004 he filed for bankruptcy owing more than $900,000 to several entities.
