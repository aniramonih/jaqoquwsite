On September 29, 2020, Mariah Carey, the “Always Be My Baby” singer, released a memoir detailing her whirlwind experience during her first marriage to music mogul, Tommy Mottola.
Despite their 20 years age difference, the twosome developed a connection and ultimately tied the knot in 1993. The marriage lasted five years before its heart-breaking end in 1998."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Her 2008 marriage to actor and comedian, Nick Cannon, ended after eight years. Unlike her first marriage, it yielded two children, her fraternal twins Moroccan and Monroe.</p><p>The singer has been linked with other notable personalities since finalizing her divorce in 2016, including James Packer and Bryan Tanaka. However, her relationship with Tommy Mottola, which she <a href=#>described</a> as toxic and tumultuous, had the most impact on the singer.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=MARIAH_CAREY_DISHES_ON_HER_FEELINGS_WHILE_MARRIED_TO_TOMMY_MOTTOLA></span><strong>MARIAH CAREY DISHES ON HER FEELINGS WHILE MARRIED TO TOMMY MOTTOLA</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tommy Mottola became Mariah Carey’s husband shortly after meeting her at a party and locking eyes with her. He signed her into his record, Sony Music, and helped her produce some of her top-charting tracks.</p><p>Despite their compatibility career-wise, Maria Carey and Tommy Mottola’s romance was far from perfect. In her memoir, “The Meaning Of Mariah Carey,” the 50-year-old noted that Tommy Mottola never became her prince charming.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Reflecting on their time together in <a href=#>marriage</a>, Carey described being Tommy Mottola’s wife as a “slow and steady march into captivity.”</p><p>For years, she felt she was living in an iron-clad dungeon, with the music mogul constantly trying to exert his control over her. Overall, the marriage became tumultuous and too toxic to bear. She needed an escape route.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=BONDING_WITH_DEREK_JETER></span><strong>BONDING WITH DEREK JETER</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Mariah Carey eventually found the escape she needed in baseball shortstop, Derek Jeter. She met the baseball star at a dinner and instantly became drawn to him after learning of their shared biracial identities.</p><p>The singer <a href=#>detailed</a> in her memoir how they hit it off at once and began exchanging flirtatious gestures. Jeter soon became the “prince charming” figure in her life, and their friendship developed into something bigger.</p><p>Carey found herself seeking solace with the athlete, who had become her very good friend. At some point, she started sneaking out of her “dungeon” with the help of her assistant, to hook up with Jeter.</p><p>Eventually, their first kiss happened on a rooftop, which later became the inspiration for her song, “The Roof.” Going further, Carey explained how connecting with her newfound friend felt like breaking her bars of captivity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_20200930-233056_1601505343174.jpg><p>Gradually, she mustered the courage to appear defiant with Mottola, and eventually, <a href=#>pushed</a> for a divorce despite feeling she was risking her life. Once the former Sony Music executive granted the divorce, she became intimate with Derek Jeter.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=DEREK_JETERS_ROLE_IN_MARIAH_CAREYS_WHIRLWIND_ROMANCE_WITH_MOTTOLA></span><strong>DEREK JETER’S ROLE IN MARIAH CAREY’S WHIRLWIND ROMANCE WITH MOTTOLA</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>At the onset of her romance with Jeter, Carey believed he was her soulmate. Their relationship soon took a lousy turn, eventually leading to a split.</p><p>Despite being short-lived, her romance with Jeter played a considerable part in her life. The icon shared details about her connection to Jeter in her book, “The Meaning Of Mariah Carey,” and his contribution to her first marriage.</p><p>She <a href=#>described</a> the baseball star as the catalyst she needed to escape Mottola’s crippling control and connect with her sensuality.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%9CTHE_MEANING_OF_MARIAH_CAREY%E2%80%9D_DETAILED_CAREYS_POST-DIVORCE_STRUGGLES></span><strong>“THE MEANING OF MARIAH CAREY” DETAILED CAREY’S POST-DIVORCE STRUGGLES</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tommy Mottola’s stifling control on Mariah Carey did not end after their divorce. It filtered into her professional life, more evident in her 2001 work on “Glitter.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>In her book, Carey <a href=#>detailed</a> how her ex-husband interfered with every step of the film. His anger over the <a href=#>divorce</a> and her exit from Sony Music sent him on a mission to punish her. Through his power, connection, and influence, he strived to stop her success, and the success of her movie, “Glitter.”</p><p>Her hardships led her to rehab, before her eventual diagnosis with somatization. Maria Carey <a href=#>described</a> the entire experience as a trip to hell. Luckily, she survived the ordeal and returned “covered in the light of restoration.”</p><p>After her encounter with Mottola, Mariah Carey resolved never to let anyone else stop her or “take all my power” ever again.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=TOMMY_MOTTOLAS_REACTION_TO_MARIAH_CAREYS_MEMOIR></span><strong>TOMMY MOTTOLA’S REACTION TO MARIAH CAREY’S MEMOIR</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Shortly after the announcement of Mariah Carey’s revealing memoir, Mottola released a statement expressing his sentiments. He <a href=#>shared</a>:</p><p><strong>“I am deeply gratified to have played that role in Mariah’s well-deserved and remarkable success. I continue to wish her and her family only the best.”</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Before Carey’s revelation about their marriage, Tommy Mottola opened up about their relationship in his 2013 book, “Hitmaker: The Man And His Music.” He <a href=#>referred</a> to their union as “absolutely wrong and inappropriate.”</p><p>Over the years, the echoes of their whirlwind romance have helped shape the former couple into accomplished Hollywood veterans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqK%2ByJqfZpuRp7K6edOopKaxXaK8tcDOpZhmr5iev63DyKebZqqfoq6vr8Ro</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
