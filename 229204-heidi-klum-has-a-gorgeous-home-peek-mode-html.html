Helene, Henry, Johan, and Lou have been enjoying their comfortable home, even though quarantine has kept them inside more than expected. Fortunately, there is enough room for everyone.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>POSH PLACE</strong></p><p class=dh>The German-born TV personality’s house <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-a_afOprIN/>features six bedrooms</a> and nine bathrooms so that none of the kids argue over shower time. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CAA392Vp5fA/>Klum’s master bedroom</a> has an elegant king-sized bed and some artwork decorating the space.</p><p class=dh>Inside the house, there are several living rooms and dining areas that work well for any stylish dinner or a kid’s party.
