When they move through to the Final level they have the chance of being crowned the Ultimate Beastmaster.</p><h3>How to apply for Ultimate Beastmaster season 4</h3><p>Ultimate Beastmaster has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>a casting website</span></a>, which also has details on what they look for in ideal candidates.</p><p>They say:</p><p>We are looking for ordinary men and women with extraordinary athletic abilities. Contestants must be fit, athletic, have strength, speed, agility, balance and endurance.</p><p>You don’t have to be a professional athlete although most of the previous contestants have been dance teachers, swimming coaches or pro freerunners. So some athletic background is necessary!</p><p>The application form on the website is recruiting for the 2017 series, but they do provide an email address if you are looking to express interest in participating. You can email them at <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=e1b48d95888c809584a3848092958c8092958493d3a1868c80888dcf828e8c>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>.</p><h3>When will season 4 start?</h3><p>The start dates for the previous series have all varied.</p><p>Season 1 aired in February 2017, with season 2 coming to Netflix just ten months later in December.</p><p>Season 3 dropped on Netflix on August 31st, 2018 and this is the longest the series has ever gone without coming to air.
