Klarissa was born in 1992 and is presently 31 years old.</strong></p><p>Freddie Highmore started acting as a child and has over the years become a well-established actor. In addition to his thriving career, he is a married man. He married Klarissa Munz in 2021 and they have remained together ever since. Munz does not have a career in the entertainment industry and prefers to keep a low profile, but by virtue of being the wife of Freddie Highmore, she has a spot in the limelight.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Klarissa Munz’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><span><strong>AGE:</strong> 31 years old</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTHYEAR:</strong> 1992</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTHPLACE:</strong> London, United Kingdom</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTH SIGN:</strong> NA</span></li><li><span><strong>ETHNICITY:</strong> White</span></li><li><strong>NATIONALITY:</strong> British</li></ul><h2><strong>Klarissa Munz Was Born in London, United Kingdom</strong></h2><p>Klarissa Munz was born in London, United Kingdom, and is a British national of white ethnic background. It is not clear when she was born but some unverified reports show that she and her husband share the same age. So, if the information is anything to go by, then Klarissa was born in 1992 and is now 31 years old, just like Freddie.</p><p>Nothing is publicly known about Klarissa’s family background and upbringing, the identities of her parents, and any siblings she may have. After her high school education, Klarissa Munz proceeded to The University of Cambridge, England, and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Theology and Religious Studies.</p><h2><strong>What Does Klarissa Munz Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Although Klarissa Munz gained public and media recognition following her marriage to Freddie Highmore, she is also a career woman. According to records, she is a professional web designer/developer. She reportedly works at Radical Departures as a contract-front end developer.</p><p>Klarissa had previously worked as a web development immersive student in other companies such as General Assembly and as an international research executive at Flamingo. Meanwhile, in addition to her degree certificate, she has acquired several other skills such as JavaScript, HTML, SASS, Cascading Style Sheets, and jQuery.</p><h2><strong>Who is Freddie Highmore Married To?</strong></h2><p>British actor Freddie Highmore is married to Klarissa Munz and their union has lasted for 2 years. It is not known exactly when and where the duo first met but it is believed that they must have met at Cambridge University where both of them graduated from. It is also not known when exactly they got married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/w.png><p>The public did not even know that the actor was married until he himself confirmed it in September 2021 while speaking at Jimmy Kimmel Live. The show host, Kimmel, noticed that Highmore was wearing a ring which prompted him to ask; “That’s a wedding ring, yes?” to which he answered yes. “Yes, it is a wedding ring. Yes, I recently got married.”</p><p>Although he didn’t mention the name of his wife, he said she is also British, but further investigation and research revealed it is Klarissa Munz. So, apparently, Klarissa and Freddie had a secret wedding. The couple keeps their marital life completely far from the public eye and it is not known whether they have kids together yet. They currently live in London where they are individually pursuing their careers.</p><p>Meanwhile, before Freddie’s revelation of their marriage, he and Klarissa had previously been spotted together at some events such as the Critics Choice Awards and Golden Globes in 2018. Later in the year, she visited the actor on the set of the TV series, Bates Motel. Furthermore, Munz was present in 2021 when Freddie was filming the Leonardo series.</p><h2><strong>Is Freddie Highmore’s Wife Sarah Bolger?</strong></h2><p>Sarah Bolger is not Freddie Highmore’s wife. The duo who are costars in The Spiderwick Chronicles only reportedly dated sometime in the past; between 2006 and 2008. Apart from Bolger, however, other women Freddie Highmore dated before he got married to Munz include Dakota Fanning, Abigail Breslin, and Emma Roberts.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecWrnJ2cmZp6qbXGoaSoqpWoerS8zq6qnmWboa6ztdKsmGalpaPHcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
