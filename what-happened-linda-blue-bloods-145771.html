We only found out about the ER nurse’s tragic fate through Danny’s therapy session with Dr. Dawson, as the latter tried to assuage Danny’s feelings of guilt.</p><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><p>“Linda’s death wasn’t your fault,” the therapist told Donnie's character. “She was doing her job. She died doing what she loved. She died in a helicopter crash, airlifting her patient.”</p><p>At Blue Bloods’ PaleyLive NY event in October, the cast confirmed actress Amy chose not to renew her contract. (Amy had been on the show since the series premiere and earned a series regular status in Season 2.) In a statement, the 49-year-old star waxed nostalgic about her experience.</p><p>“My heart is full of gratitude to each of you for your generous support of me and my character for the last seven years,” she said. “I loved playing Linda: wife to Danny, mother to Jack and Sean, nurse, and working mom. I’m proud of my contribution to building this series… Mostly, I am grateful to the fans who have supported me and the show.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Donnie has nothing but appreciation for his TV wife. “In my 35-year acting/singing career, I’ve worked with some great talents,” he tweeted earlier in the eighth season. “Amy Carlson and [my former Blue Bloods co-star] Jennifer Esposito are two of the greatest… I know many Blue Bloods fans will miss Linda Reagan. None more than me. <a href=#>Amy Carlson is a gift</a>, a light, and a true friend on and off-screen.” Hey, they’ll always be family, right?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZZyeu6WtjJujrp1dl7mwu8OsZGpsZWyEcns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
