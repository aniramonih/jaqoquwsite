Till’s death became a symbol of the racial violence and injustice that African Americans faced in the segregated South.
On August 24, 1955, Till arrived from Chicago in Money, Mississippi, to visit his family. A few days later, he and some friends went to a local grocery store, where Till allegedly whistled at a white woman named Carolyn Bryant."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A few days later, he and some friends went to a local grocery store, where Till allegedly whistled at a white woman named Carolyn Bryant.&nbsp;</p><p>A few nights later, Till was kidnapped from his uncle’s home by Carolyn Bryant’s husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, J.W. Milam.</p><p>Till was brutally beaten, shot, and dumped in the Tallahatchie River.&nbsp;</p><p>After being abducted and murdered, Till’s disfigured body was discovered in the Tallahatchie River three days later by two boys fishing, with his head badly mutilated, evidence of beating on his back and hips, and a fan blade fastened around his neck with barbed wire.</p><p>Despite wearing a silver ring with the initials “L.T.” and a date, his face was unrecognizable due to trauma and being submerged in water.</p><p>His body was so mutilated that Till’s mother could only identify him by his distinctive ring.&nbsp;</p><p>The brutal nature of Till’s murder, and the fact that it was motivated by racial hatred, shocked the nation.</p><p>Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam were arrested and charged with Till’s murder, but they were eventually acquitted by an all-white jury in a trial that lasted only five days.</p><p>The defense argued that Till had violated the social code of the South by making advances on a white woman. The acquittal outraged many black and white Americans and contributed to the civil rights movement.</p><p>Till’s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, insisted on an open-casket funeral so that the world could see what had been done to her son. The images of Till’s mutilated body were widely circulated, and they helped galvanize support for the civil rights movement.</p><p>In the years after Till’s murder, his story continued to inspire activists and artists. Bob Dylan wrote a song about Till, and his death was referenced in several works of literature and film.</p><p>In 2004, the Department of Justice reopened the case, and in 2005, Till’s body was exhumed for an autopsy. The results of the <a href=#>autopsy</a> revealed that Till had suffered extensive injuries, including a fractured skull, and that he had been shot in the head.</p><p>Despite the new evidence, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam were never charged with Till’s murder again, as they had been acquitted once before and were protected by double jeopardy.</p><p>However, the case remains an important reminder of the racial violence and injustice that African Americans faced in the South during the Jim Crow era.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCxzKacraxdqbatuIyfmJydXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
