And things will only get better for him as he gets older as due to how cool his godfather is. Multimillionaire Guy Pelly has been friends with both <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Prince William</a> and <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Prince Harry</a> since the Windsor boys were at school.</p><p>Known as a ‘London aristocrat,’ he’s a former nightclub manager renowned for transforming Mayfair’s Mahiki into one of London’s biggest celebrity attractions. He’s also managed the famous London nightclubs Public, Whisky Mist and Tonteria nightclubs too. And it seems that he too hails from a legacy family - His mum Lady Carolyn Herbert was close friends with the late Diana, Princess of Wales.</p><p>In fact, he’s so close to the royals that he organised Prince William’s stag do in 2011, where a group of them enjoyed a luxurious weekend at a friend’s country estate.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Royal Family: Prince William praised for quietly selling Big Issue on London streets</a></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article24184318.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_GettyImages-979983824.jpg><p>However, not everything Guy Pelly has done has portrayed him and the royals in a positive light. He was alongside Prince Harry back in 2005 when the Prince infamously wore a Nazi costume to a fancy dress party.</p><p>The Royal Family’s friends also once stole the show at a royal wedding. Prince William married Kate Middleton on April 29 2011 - but one little girl stole the show as the newlyweds waved from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Grace van Cutsem, William's goddaughter and the daughter of one of his best mates, found the noise a bit too much.</p><p>She served as one of Kate Middleton’s bridesmaids and was famously pictured covering her ears and screwing up her face while Will and Kate enjoyed their first kiss. Maybe the big day wasn't for everyone.</p><p>And not only that, Grace is the daughter of Prince William’s best friend - another William. William van Cutsem's family go back an awfully long way with the Windsor-Mountbattens.</p><p>William van Cutsem’s dad was Hugh van Cutsem Sr - Prince Charles' best friend from Cambridge. Hugh had four sons: Nicholas, Edward, William, and Hugh Jr.</p><p><b>Got a story?
