Now, all the deals are in full swing.&nbsp;</p><h3>Where are the best Oculus Quest 2 Black Friday deals?</h3><p>The best Oculus Quest 2 deals can be found here of course; all weekend, we’ll let you know about the deals we think are great and some Quest 2 deals you might be best to avoid. If you want to do your own deal hunting, here are the sites we’d recommend.</p><p><strong>US Oculus Quest 2 sales</strong></p><p><strong>UK Oculus Quest 2 sales</strong></p><h3>What Black Friday Oculus Quest 2 deals are we seeing in 2023?</h3><p>Last year for Black Friday, Meta offered a pretty good bundle deal that not only shaved money off the Quest 2 headset but gave you a fantastic VR game for free in Resident Evil 4 VR. This year we’re seeing something similar with Asgard's Wrath, though we’re not super sure what to expect across the weekend because the Quest 2 is in a very different place than it was in 2022.</p><p>Firstly the VR headset got a major price drop down to $299.99 / £299.99 for the 128GB version and $349.99 / £349.99 for the 256GB model earlier this year. This is the price it was before a major price hike in August 2022 and we’re not sure Meta will go much lower on it, because the headset is apparently already a loss leader.</p><p>Secondly, Meta now has the new Meta Quest 3. It’s only just launched and while new tech typically makes older generations go down in price Meta might not want to distract us from its shiny new gadget as we head into the all-important holiday season by offering an amazing Quest 2 deal.&nbsp;</p><p>So at best we expect the Quest 2 is also bundled with an accessory like the Elite Strap in some places,&nbsp;but won’t have a proper discount.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHCoamanJGne6S7zGiZpZmToHqnvsidmLJnn5jCrcHSZqiunaOpeqO4wJyiZp6inrGixYydnJqkow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
