It’s not as glaring as maybe in years past where like, ‘Hey, we really need X, we really need this,’ and they went out and got it. Regardless of what we do at the trade deadline, we’re going for it. I think that’s great. I think we know that going into every season, and spring training was no different. I mean, we signed Freddie. We got everything we need right here,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clayton Kershaw</a> told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Athletic</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Also Read: <a href=#>Watch: 3 Major League Baseball teams who would want to capitalize the August trade deadline</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nothing is ruled out yet for Clayton Kershaw</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG-0383-1024x576.jpg><p><a href=#>Betts</a>, Turner, and Freeman have all performed admirably for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Dodgers</a> thus far. Betts recently hit his 200th career home run, while Turner and Freeman lead the major leagues in hits, respectively. Just a few weeks ago, Freeman hit his 1000th career RBI. Add in Bellinger and Trayce Thompson, whose bats have recently begun to heat up, and the Dodgers’ offence has clearly taken off. As evidenced by the team’s recent 13-0 victory over the Rockies.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#BREAKING</a> Source: <a href=#>#Angels</a> owner Arte Moreno, has given the green light to his front office, to pursue a possible Shohei Ohtani trade to the Los Angeles <a href=#>#Dodgers</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>#Angels</a> scouts are very high on the <a href=#>#Dodgers</a> top prospects, and consider them key to any rebuild.</p>— MLB Insider (@1MLBinsider) <a href=#>July 29, 2022</a></figure><p>Andrew Friedman, on the other hand, is always ten steps ahead and has backups of backups.
