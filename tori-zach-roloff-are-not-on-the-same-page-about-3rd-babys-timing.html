His wife, 29, chimed in, “If he could birth them, then I would be like, ‘Go for it.’ I’m a little bit more like, ‘Let’s just enjoy what we have for a minute."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He loves to play with her for five minutes, and then he’s kind of over it. But he’s a good big brother. He helps her a lot, which is nice.”</p><p>The couple’s youngest is reaching many new milestones, she added. “She’s sitting up now, which is really nice when she wants to. She’s kind of a princess. She’s like, ‘I’d rather have somebody hold me up.’ But she’s talking a lot, babbling, loves her brother. She’s moving everywhere. You can’t put her down anymore.”</p><p>As for their toddler, Jackson is “pretty good” behavior-wise, but “asks the same question over and over again.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Little People, Big World airs on TLC Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatp6KeerutwqFkq6ecpLOnecCrnGamn6l6sLqMrZ%2BeZaOWuqZ5z5qenmWRl7y2wIxsqZ1lkpavur%2BMraCmoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
