The groovy track deals with the fallout of his relationship in benny’s typical, open-mannered way while electric guitars and fluid piano chords accompany his struggle to understand the new situation. Since its release on Friday, the song already accumulated 60,000 streams on streaming services.</p><p>While you may have known all about that, you may not have known that we have sat down exclusively with the artist himself to talk about all of the questions that we have been dying to ask him.</p><p>Check out the fun, little interview below to find out more about benny mayne’s inspiration, his opinion on Rihanna and the final verdict on the state of pineapple on pizza:</p><p><strong>Hey benny, lovely to meet you, we’re big fans over here! Tell us, how excited are you for the release of your brand new track?</strong></p><p>I get excited every time I release something, but this one is special [to me].</p><p><strong>“basic b*tch” is a step away from your first track “bounce”, musical- and lyrical-wise. What was your inspiration to do it?</strong></p><p>Heartbreak and Hennessy.</p><p><strong>Which of your songs are you most proud of doing? (Or are you not allowed to tell, kind of like parents when you ask them which one is their favorite child)</strong></p><p>They are all my babies.</p><p><strong>You topped the SoundCloud charts with your first releases and “bounce” already has almost half a million streams. Were you shocked when you saw that kind of reception?</strong></p><p>I think if it didn’t do well, I’d lose my mind so I am grateful people like it.</p><p><strong>What was your favorite reaction that someone had to your songs?</strong></p><p>“omg i’m pregnant”</p><p><strong>That’s awesome! Which artist would you love to work with in the future?</strong></p><p>Rihanna</p><p><strong>If you had to describe your music in a couple of words, which would they be?</strong></p><p>“Not for everyone”</p><p><strong>We always love to find out about artists’ personal taste in music. So if you had to narrow them down: which are your 5 current favorite tracks?</strong></p><p>Brent Faiyaz – Make Luv<br>Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ – Paris<br>Terrell Morris – Pretty Life<br>Noah – Smoke Away My Sins<br>Tory Lanez – In For It</p><p><strong>What else does 2018 have in store for you?</strong></p><p>Rockstar shit</p><p><strong>Last but not least, a question that is on all of our minds: does pineapple deserve to be on pizza or not?</strong></p><p>If you like eating pineapple on pizza, you are probably a murderer.</p><p><strong>Thank you so much for the interview.</strong></p><p>Thank you for having good questions!</p><p>We heard through the grapevine that benny mayne has been busy in the studio with producers such as Rock Mafia (who have worked with Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus and Zedd) as well as Williedonut (who has produced for Fergie as well as Justin Bieber) so you should definitely stay tuned for more great things to come in the future!</p><p>If you want to, you can keep up with the artist right here:</p><p><a href=#>Facebook</a></p><p><a href=#>Instagram</a></p><p><a href=#>SoundCloud</a></p><p><a href=#>YouTube</a>.</p><p>Also be sure to check out benny’s latest release “basic b*tch”, as well as his other releases on the digital retailer/streaming platform of your choice!</p><p><strong>What do you think about benny mayne</strong><strong>?
