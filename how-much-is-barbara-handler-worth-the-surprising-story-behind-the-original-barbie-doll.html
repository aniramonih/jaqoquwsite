The Surprising Story Behind The Original Barbie Doll</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-13</div><p>Barbara Handler is the daughter of Ruth and Elliot Handler, the co-founders of Mattel, the toy company that created the iconic Barbie doll. Barbara was the inspiration for the doll’s name and appearance, as her mother wanted to create a toy that would allow girls to imagine their future as adult women. But how much is Barbara Handler worth today, and what is her connection to the Barbie empire? Here are some facts you may not know about the real-life Barbie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Barbara Handler’s Early Life and Family</h2><p>Barbara Handler was born on May 21, 1941 in Los Angeles, California¹. Her parents reportedly only had $14 in their bank account the day she was born¹. She had a younger brother named Kenneth, who was also the namesake for the Ken doll⁵.</p><p>Barbara loved playing with dolls as a young girl, and she inspired her mother to create the first Barbie doll during a family trip to Europe in 1956¹. As they walked down a street in Switzerland, Barbara stumbled upon a curvy plastic doll in a store window, and was mesmerized by it¹. The doll was a Bild Lilli fashion doll, which was based on a German comic strip character¹. It was made of plastic, and had the ability to change outfits, which was a rare feature at the time¹.</p><p>Barbara’s mother bought four of the dolls for her, but she never saw them again after the trip¹. Ruth Handler took them apart and researched them, and came up with the idea of creating a similar doll for the American market¹. She named the doll Barbie, after her daughter’s nickname¹. She also designed different outfits and accessories for the doll, which were sold separately¹.</p><p>The first Barbie doll debuted at the New York Toy Fair in 1959, and became an instant hit¹. It was marketed as a “teen-age fashion model”, and had blonde or brunette hair, blue eyes, and a slim figure¹. It also had a boyfriend named Ken, who was introduced in 1961⁵. Ken was named after Barbara’s brother, who was also involved in the toy business as a director and composer for Mattel’s commercials and films⁵.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Barbara Handler’s Relationship with Barbie</h2><p>Barbara Handler was 18 years old when Barbie came out, and she did not like being associated with the doll¹. She felt that it was odd and embarrassing to have people ask her for her autograph or call her “the real Barbie” ¹. She also did not think that the doll looked like her or represented her personality¹.</p><p>She told The New York Times in 1994: “When people came up and say to me, ‘Oh, you’re the real Barbie,’ I couldn’t understand it because that’s just a name that was given to the doll, but a lot of people thought that they modeled it after me and they made it look like me, and that I was supposed to be it. That’s not true.” ¹</p><p>She also said that she did not play with Barbie dolls as a teenager, and preferred paper dolls instead ¹. She said that she liked paper dolls because they were more creative and allowed her to draw her own clothes for them ¹.</p><p>Barbara’s brother Kenneth also disliked being known as the inspiration for Ken ⁵. He said that he was nothing like the doll, who was portrayed as a surfer and a beach boy ⁵. He described himself as “a real nerd” who played the piano and watched foreign movies in high school ⁵.</p><p>Barbara and Kenneth both tried to distance themselves from their parents’ toy empire, and pursued their own careers and interests ⁵. Barbara studied at UCLA and became a philanthropist ⁴. She founded the Barbara Handler Foundation, which provides funding to groups that encourage women’s empowerment ⁴. She also married Allen Segal, a businessman who owned several clothing stores ².</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Barbara Handler’s Net Worth</h2><p>It is not clear what Barbara Handler’s current net worth is, but her mother Ruth was worth about $100 million when she died in 2002 ³. Ruth Handler left behind a legacy of innovation and success in the toy industry, as well as controversy and lawsuits over patent infringements and health issues ³.</p><p>Barbara most likely inherited some money from her mother, but the exact amount is unknown. She has not been involved in Mattel’s business or profits since she sold her shares in 1984 ². She has also been living a quiet and retired life, away from the spotlight and the media ².</p><p>Barbara Handler is now 82 years old, and has three children and six grandchildren ². She has not appeared in any public events or interviews related to Barbie or Mattel in recent years ². She did, however, give her seal of approval for the upcoming Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie, and praised her role as the popular doll ⁵.</p><p>Barbara Handler may not have a lot in common with the doll that bears her name, but she is still an important part of the Barbie story. She is the original inspiration for the toy that has become a cultural icon and a symbol of female empowerment. She is also a successful and generous woman who has made a difference in the world through her philanthropy. Barbara Handler may not be Barbie, but she is certainly worth celebrating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e9KtpquxX528uHnMrpqhZZmoeqOt0ZuYq5ldna6vsMueqWavn6fBqXnToZxmq6WnvbO10qKloGWjqbyzxYybnKGhnpl6tbTEZqaroZeeu6K4jJuYq5qZmnqlu8ulZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
