Josephine’s ex-husband, John, was an American actor and filmmaker. Nicknamed Duke Wayne, John became a famous icon by starring in films made during Hollywood’s Golden Age, especially in Western and war movies.</p><p>Actor John Wayne’s professional life was hugely successful, with the beloved figure becoming one of the most iconic names in film history. However, his personal life didn’t record as much success. Although John married multiple times, Josephine Wayne was the first woman John took to the altar.</p><p>Hence, his marriage to Josephine was his first and the start of various unsuccessful, controversial marriages. Here’s a look into the life of Josephine Wayne, her marriage to the actor, her children, divorce, and cause of death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-24_06-13-46-fotor-2023102462034.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Was_John_Waynes_First_Wife></span>Who Was John Wayne’s First Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Josephine Wayne was born Josephine Sáenz in El Paso, El Paso County, Texas, United States, on May 13, 1908, to Jose Santos Saenz Macho and Alicia Acosta. According to reports, her father, Jose Saenz, was the Consul General of Panama in the United States and a wealthy businessman who lived in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>Hence, John Wayne’s first wife grew up in a wealthy home.&nbsp;However, she came into the limelight after marrying the renowned actor. Consequently, details about her early life elude the media. In addition, information regarding her educational background and achievements also remains a mystery.</p><p>However, the renowned actor’s first wife grew up in a stable home with her parents and siblings. While she cloaked her early life in secrecy, reports suggest she grew up in a Catholic home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Josephine_Wayne_and_John_Wayne_Meet></span>How Did Josephine Wayne and John Wayne Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Josephine Wayne and John met through John’s friend, William Bakewell. At the time, John was a scholarship student at the University of Southern California in 1925, where he joined the Sigma Chi Fraternity. Shortly after sustaining an injury that saw him lose his scholarship, one of his fraternity brothers set him up on a blind date with a beautiful girl called Carmen Saenz.</p><p>After they had gone to the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa and returned to the girl’s home, John met her sister, Josephine, and he was immediately attracted to her. Consequently, John and Josephine started going out together. According to the late actor, Josephine was “unlike any other woman he had met;” she was classy and embodied intelligence, breeding, and composure.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-24_06-14-22-fotor-202310246213.jpg><p>Although John fell in love with Josephine quickly, the latter, on the other hand, was skeptical about him. Also, her family was not in full support of their relationship. In addition, the late actor’s reputation as a football player from a broken marriage who had lost his scholarship and was living in Glendale did not help his cause.</p><p>Since John and Josephine were from different social classes, many felt the former was punching above his weight. While Josephine’s parents liked that Wayne was sincere, Josephine was impressed by the actor’s looks. Hence, the former couple found a way to keep their relationship alive for years.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_John_Wayne_and_His_First_Wife_Tie_the_Knot></span>When Did John Wayne and His First Wife Tie the Knot?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In December 1932, Josephine and John Wayne announced their engagement.

The then-couple had a private ceremony with their loved ones.</p><p>Some of the couple’s friends present at the ceremony include Henry Fonda and Grant Withers.

According to reports, Josephine restricted John’s access to her body after four kids because she did not want more. Hence, the actor started having an affair with his co-star, actress Marlene Dietrich and neglected Josephine.&nbsp;</p><p>Although his affairs were public knowledge, John Wayne’s first wife tried to keep their marriage together. Hence, she asked a priest, Father McCoy, to come to their home and counsel her husband about his extramarital affairs.

Afterward, John Wayne and his first wife had their second son and third child, Patrick, in 1939.</p><p>Lastly, the former couple welcomed Melinda in 1940. Like Josephine, most details about her children elude the media. However, of her children, only <a href=#>Patrick Wayne</a> is still alive. Nonetheless, he lives away from the limelight. Aside from his children with Josephine, John had three more children with his second wife, Pilar Palette, Ethan, Aissa, and Marisa Wayne.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Josephine_Waynes_Cause_of_Death></span>What Is Josephine Wayne’s Cause of Death?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Josephine Wayne died on June 24, 2003, in California, USA.
