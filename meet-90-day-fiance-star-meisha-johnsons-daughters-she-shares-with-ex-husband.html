They appeared at the Tell All wearing pink and blue dresses to support their mother, who described them as “strong.”</p><p>She said that her daughters would “put him [Nicola] in his place.” Meisha welcomed the daughters from a previous marriage. They go to church with Meisha, who works as a spiritual director there.</p><p>Aged 20 and 18 years old, one of her daughters is part of the college sorority group, Delta Zeta, in Arizona. They felt Nicola “isn’t listening to her” following their mom sharing her concerns.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-old-is-meisha-on-90-day-fiance>How old is Meisha on 90 Day Fiance?</h2><p>Meisha Johnson on 90 Day Fiance is 43 years old while Nicola is 46 in age. She worked as a&nbsp;journalist and a reporter&nbsp;for over 10 years under several major networks, including FOX and <a href=#>CBS</a>.</p><p>Nicola’s best friend can’t even understand why the divorced mother would want to be with a virgin who is approaching 50 and lives across the world with his mother in Israel.</p><p>Meisha is still determined to travel to Israel to meet and marry Nicola. She had an intense spiritual discovery a number of years ago when she had a vision of two burning suns while she was vacuuming.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I really like Meisha's daughters. <a href=#>#90DayFiance</a> <a href=#>#90DayFianceBeforeThe90Days</a></p>— Not My Circus (@MaybeIMAmazed30) <a href=#>September 25, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-get-to-know-meisha-s-ex-husband>Get to know Meisha’s ex-husband</h2><p>Meisha told Nicola that she finally was granted an annulment. Meisha had been waiting for it for a year and a half. The Tribunal for the Archdiocese had to decide if she could marry again.</p><p>However, Meisha’s daughters feel they will be judged by Nicola for doing regular teenage stuff.
