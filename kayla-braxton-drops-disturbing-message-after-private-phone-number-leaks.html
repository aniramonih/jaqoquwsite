However, she also has her fair share of haters no matter what she does.</p><p>The WWE personality recently took to her <a href=#>Instagram stories and</a> uploaded a video, where she mentioned how she has been continuously getting calls, text messages, and facetime from an unknown number since her number got leaked.</p><p>“So last night I was having a good night trying to enjoy hanging out with friends I haven’t seen in a while and my phone is continuously being called by an unknown number. Last couple of days my phone has been called, facetimed, and been getting extremely rude and inappropriate and alarming text messages.</p><p>Apparently, my number has been leaked ever since this happened. This is harassment, I don’t know if you guys are doing this without knowing what this means, but those of you who have been continuously making these calls and texts and facetimes, I’ve sent forager information along to someone who’s gonna handle this in a different way. Y’all stop it.”</p><p>Braxton’s credit&nbsp;<a href=#>card was also stolen recently</a>, so she might be in an overall bad mood. That is totally understandable, because it sounds like she was the victim of identity theft.</p><p>Kayla Braxton still tries to take things in stride, no matter who hates her for no reason, but we do hope she can finally catch a break sometimes.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p><strong>Do you feel bad for Braxton?
