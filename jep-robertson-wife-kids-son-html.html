In addition, they were young college students, and Jep struggled with drugs, whereas Jessica has a rough past due to her previous relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, for the first seven or eight years of marriage, Jep's wife said they could "barely make ends meet." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>'Love will keep us alive'&nbsp;was quite their reality back then. So while other couples may have faltered by the pressure and stress, Jep's relationship with his wife only grew stronger over time.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Jep Robertson With His Wife, Jessia Robertson (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</strong></p><p><strong>Get to know -&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Is Beauty and the Beast Star Josh Gad Gay?</a></strong></p><p>Moreover, Jep's qualities as a man kept his wife beside him.
