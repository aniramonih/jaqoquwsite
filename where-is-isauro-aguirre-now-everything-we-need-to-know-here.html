Gabriel was tortured by Aguirre and Pearl because they suspected he was gay. Aguirre tortured Gabriel to the point where he was forced to eat cat feces in addition to physical abuse.</p><p>Although Aguirre had no criminal record and appeared to be a decent man based on social worker reports, he began to deteriorate after meeting Pearl. It’s been speculated that Aguirre’s intellectual disabilities and learning difficulties made him vulnerable to Pearl’s influence. His sister and former girlfriends testified that he was once caring and helpful, and his former employer also spoke highly of him.</p><p>Despite his previous reputation, Aguirre’s actions towards Gabriel elevate him to the status of living monster. While the merits of capital punishment can be debated, it is clear that Aguirre deserves the harshest punishment possible.</p><p>Gabriel was subjected to unspeakable abuse and torture, which ultimately led to his death. This tragic case highlights the long-term effects of trauma on children and the need for society to invest in resources to support children who have been abused, neglected, or subjected to other forms of trauma.</p><h2><span id=What_happened_to_Isauro_Aguirre>What happened to Isauro Aguirre?</span></h2><p>Isauro Aguirre is a death row inmate at California’s San Quentin State Prison. Throughout the trial, Aguirre showed no remorse for his actions. He avoided making eye contact, shed no tears, and continued to roll his hands. On June 13, 2018, he was sentenced to death for murder and murder by torture and was transferred to San Quentin State Prison in California.</p><p>Aguirre is currently 39 years old and incarcerated. However, due to ongoing legal battles in California over capital punishment, he may not be executed for months or even years. Despite Aguirre’s previous reputation, public opinion turned against him after Gabriel died. His heinous actions infuriated the public, who demanded justice.</p><p>Even though some positive things were said about him during the trial, the fact that he committed a heinous crime and deserved to be sentenced did not change. A Facebook group advocating for Gabriel’s justice emphasizes the intense hatred many people have for Aguirre for what he did to the innocent boy.</p><h2><span id=Is_Isauro_Aguirre_still_alive_and_well>Is Isauro Aguirre still alive and well?</span></h2><p>Yes, Isauro Aguirre is still alive and well. It’s difficult to imagine how he could kill an eight-year-old boy. Gabriel Fernandez was abused and tortured for months before his death and was not protected despite reports to social services and law enforcement. This tragedy emphasizes the importance of better training for professionals who work with children, such as teachers and healthcare workers, to recognize and report signs of child abuse and neglect.</p><p>Gabriel’s case was reported to social services several times, but he was abandoned by his mother and her boyfriend. This demonstrates the danger of ignoring reports of abuse and the importance of taking them seriously, thoroughly investigating them, and acting quickly to protect the child.</p><p>Isauro Aguirre was held accountable and sentenced to death for his role in Gabriel’s murder. This serves as a reminder of the importance of justice for victims and their families, as well as for society as a whole.</p><h2><span id=When_will_Isauro_Aguirre_be_executed>When will Isauro Aguirre be executed?</span></h2><p>His execution date has yet to be announced. Isauro Aguirre was sentenced to death on June 13, 2018, after being found guilty of the murder of Gabriel Fernandez. He was immediately admitted to San Quentin State Prison. Aguirre, a 39-year-old Palmdale, California resident, has been on death row since then.</p><p>Some of these criminals have been on death row since the 1970s, according to ABC7. Since 1983, when Michael Angelo Morales challenged the procedure’s inhumanity, the number of annual executions has decreased significantly. Clarence Ray Allen, who received a lethal injection on January 17, 2006, was the last person executed in California.</p><p>All executions in California have been halted until a new decision on their legality is reached, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. As a result, the fate of Isauro Aguirre is ultimately determined by the relevant authorities.</p><p>Gabriel was tortured, according to the prosecutor in Aguirre’s trial, because Aguirre and Pearl Fernandez thought he was gay. This demonstrates the devastation caused by discrimination and the need for society to work toward greater acceptance and understanding of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p><h2><span id=What_happened_to_Isauro_Aguirre_and_Pearl_Fernandez>What happened to Isauro Aguirre and Pearl Fernandez?</span></h2><p>Pearl Fernandez and her boyfriend Isauro Aguirre murdered her son Gabriel Fernandez in their California home in 2013. She is currently serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole at the Central California Women’s Facility. Pearl pled guilty to first-degree murder and torture-murder in 2018 but avoided the death penalty.</p><p>Her expressions of remorse, however, were rejected by the judge, who described her actions as “horrendous, inhumane, and nothing short of evil.” Jurors heard during the trial how Gabriel was tortured and abused by his mother and her boyfriend after being placed in their care eight months before his death.</p><p>Beatings, being forced to eat cat litter and feces, being shot with a BB gun, and other forms of abuse were all part of the abuse. Gabriel’s siblings, whom Pearl shared with his father Arnold Contreras, were abused as well, but not to the same degree as Gabriel. According to Deputy District Attorney Jonathan Hatami, Pearl and Aguirre tortured Gabriel because they thought he was gay.</p><p>Pearl and Aguirre beat Gabriel on the day of his murder for not cleaning up his toys. Aguirre was sentenced to death for his role in the murder, but his execution date has yet to be set due to California’s capital punishment moratorium.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Criminal</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Jack Matfin Bell- Son Of Jamie Bell and Evan Rachal Wood</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Barry Humphries Is Hospitalized Due To ‘Health Issues’</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfrLWmvsRmoKxlmaiutr7OZpigrZmnv6Z5zaiuZp2mmr%2B6wMeipaBlp5p6r7HEnWStp12gu7DDjKGcq51f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
