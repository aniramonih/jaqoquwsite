He received a liver transplant when he was just six months old, and he continued to have respiratory problems and other issues in the years that followed.&nbsp;</p><p>His health was a constant concern for his parents, and they often attended consultations and other medical appointments on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>While appearing on an episode of Watch What Happens Live in 2020, Heather shared that Jax has been "really doing fantastic."</p><p>"Well, it's a great time for an update because Jax just had a liver biopsy," Heather told host Andy Cohen on the show. "It's about seven years since we've had one, and it's one of those check-in points. He got 100 percent, full on, everything is great.
