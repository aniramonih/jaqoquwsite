The former couple asked each other extremely personal questions and had to either answer truthfully or eat a disgusting food item chosen by the other person.</p><p>For her first question, Jenner asked Styles, “Which songs on <a href=#>your last album</a> were about me?” and said she was “dying to know” the answer. Almost immediately, the former One Direction member covered his face with his hands. He then reached over for a napkin, tucked it into his shirt and grabbed a fork and knife, preparing to eat the cod sperm that the model selected for him.</p><p>After Jenner shouted, “Ew!” Styles almost reconsidered his decision. “So, I’d say track, um …” he began before hesitantly yet bravely diving into the Japanese delicacy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Harry-Styles-Eats-Cod-Sperm-to-Avoid-Telling-Ex-Kendall-Jenner-Which-Songs-He-Wrote-About-Her-inline.jpg><p>“Just swallow it!” the reality star urged the X Factor U.K. alum as he slowly chewed the cod sperm. “Stop!”</p><p>Styles then turned to the audience and asked, “To spit or to swallow, that is the question.” Ultimately, he spit it out and took a giant gulp of water.</p><p>“It really carries an aftertaste,” he said, slightly gagging.</p><p>Later in the game, the Dunkirk actor asked Jenner to name the “most unlikeable supermodel”; she had someone in mind but sipped a salmon smoothie instead. She then inquired whether he has ever watched an episode of her family’s E! reality show; he has, “the one where you’re eating salads in the kitchen and then you all were shouting at each other.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Harry-Styles-Eats-Cod-Sperm-to-Avoid-Telling-Ex-Kendall-Jenner-Which-Songs-He-Wrote-About-Her.jpg><p>The pair were briefly linked in late 2013. They sparked rumors that they had reconciled their romance in December 2015 after being <a href=#>spotted on vacation in Anguilla</a>. Then, in September 2016, they <a href=#>spent three consecutive days together</a>. However, a source close to Styles told Us Weekly at the time that the duo were just “friends” and <a href=#>“didn’t stop being friends”</a> after their relationship ended.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Styles — whose new album, <a href=#>Fine Line</a>, is out Friday, December 13 — most recently dated model <a href=#><strong>Camille Rowe</strong></a>, while Jenner’s <a href=#>split from NBA player <strong>Ben Simmons</strong></a> made headlines in May.</p><p>The Late Late Show With James Corden airs on CBS weeknights at 12:35 a.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKeppSWua15yZ6lp52iYq60t9Jmn5qqoq56tMDYpZysZaedtqS0jKymp5%2BjYrWmedarpq2dXZavsMHTZp%2Beql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
