Koe Wetzel Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴She misses Ragweed like I do
And her mama really thinks I'm trash
Along with her second step-dad too and
She's kind of weird and a full-time goof
Yeah, but she misses Ragweed like I...I wanted you to know
That you're everything to me 'Cause I've been hooked on those eyes
The way you smile, that dirty mouth saying &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Despite the fact that her mother and step-father disapprove of him, and the fact that she is quirky and a bit of a weirdo, the singer is smitten with her. He can't get enough of her dirty mouth and her unique personality. Despite their differences, they bond over their love for Ragweed and their shared desire to get drunk and high. The love between these two is unexpected and unconventional, but it is passionate and real.</p><br><p>The lyrics of "Ragweed" could be interpreted in a few different ways. Some might see it as a love story between two outcasts who find each other and connect over their shared love for an illegal substance. Others might see it as a cautionary tale about the dangers of drugs and the strange things they can make people do. Whatever interpretation one chooses, it's clear that "Ragweed" is a powerful and emotionally charged song that speaks to the hearts of many.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>She misses Ragweed like I do</u><br>Both the singer and the girl he loves miss Ragweed, a kind of plant.
