The pair built their own home, and grew their own food in the small town of Guildford, and had twins in 1978. Her boyfriend left soon after the birth of their children, and after meeting beekeeper Burt Shavitz in the early 80s, Ms. Quimby began making beeswax candles in order to supplement her income. The candles were quite successful initially, so she began developing a lip balm, as well. The lip balm, which was launched in 1991, proved to be a hit, and the company, known as Burt's Bees, grew in profitability. She bought out Mr. Shavitz in 1993, and sold the company in 2007 for $350 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeipMWius2eZKqtmaKvunnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5kXBtcWpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
