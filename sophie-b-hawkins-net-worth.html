The film was made by director Gigi Gaston. The same year, she was set to release her third album, "Timbre," but the release was delayed by Hawkins' record company, Sony Music, as record executives were unhappy with the finished product. They particularly wanted her to remove the banjo that was featured on one of the tracks. However, Hawkins refused and after a long battle, the album was released in 1999, though Sony refused to promote it.</p><p>Hawkins then left the label and decided to form her own, Trumpet Swan Production. In 2001, she re-released "Timbre" on her own label. The rerelease included remixes, videos, and some new songs. She also released a new album, "Wilderness," in 2004, her first independently recorded and released album.</p><p>She then took a break from releasing music and was generally out of the spotlight for some time.

She also has a strong international following and appeared on the German television show, "Night Grooves," in 2019, where she performed a few songs and also displayed her impressive drumming talent.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 2012, Hawkins stated that she identified as omnisexual though she did not confirm any of the rumors connecting her to various women. She has two children – Dashiell born in 2008 and Esther born in 2015. Esther was conceived using an embryo that Hawkins had frozen 20 years previously.</p><p>Hawkins has been active in politics and activism throughout her life.
