Throughout the years she’s been entertaining fans with her legendary hits, the “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!” songstress walked down the aisle with her ex-husband, <strong>Robert John “Mutt” Lange</strong>, and her current spouse, <a href=#><strong>Frédéric Thiébaud</strong></a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Grammy winner</a> met her first husband, Robert, after he offered to produce and write songs with her upon listening to her self-titled debut album in the early ’90s. The pair said I do in 1993 and waited almost a decade before welcoming their only child, <strong>Eja Lange</strong>, in August 2001.</p><p>However, Shania and Robert called it quits in 2008 after the hitmaker learned that <a href=#>Robert allegedly had an affair</a> with her best friend, <strong>Marie-Anne Thiébaud</strong>. “I can’t say I would be better off [if he hadn’t cheated] because I think I learned a lot from all of that,” Shania once shared during an appearance on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>. “I don’t regret it.”</p><p>Following the accusations, Robert denied he was dating Marie-Anne when he told <a href=#>People</a> the reason for their split was because the two were “just a growing apart.” As for Marie-Anne, she insisted, “you cannot believe everything you read in the press.”</p><p>The “Any Man of Mine” singer and Hollywood record producer were <a href=#>divorced by 2010</a>, but things didn’t remain all that bad for Shania as she found love again with Frédéric — who just so happened to be the ex-husband of Marie-Anne.</p><p>Although Shania “didn’t want to [find] love again”, she couldn’t feel more grateful to have Fred by her side. The duo walked down the aisle in 2011 and have been living a life filled with joy and love ever since.</p><p>“[Marriage] was the last thing on my mind,” she once revealed to <a href=#>People</a>. “It’s just amazing how life works. … I rejected it initially, but I couldn’t control Fred’s love for me and how easy he is to love.”</p><p>In a separate interview with <a href=#>Parade</a>, the “Come On Over” entertainer credited her new hubby with healing her broken heart. “I describe what happened to Fred and me this way: we were two people who had been jettisoned from our lives as if we’d been shoved off the edge of a high cliff,” Shania once dished. “Thankfully, we managed to grab onto each other on the way down in midair, and break each other’s fall.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to meet Shania’s ex-husband, Robert, and her current husband, Frédéric!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46sn5qmmZZ6tcPAoqVmoKWor6K6w6xkpp2VqXq1tMRmmqitnqm%2FunnPqKdmq6SWv7R50qmmrquVqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
