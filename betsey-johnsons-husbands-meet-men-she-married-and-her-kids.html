She was then seen only wearing the ‘crotch-length’ blouse and her underwear.</p><h4><strong>Why her marriage with John ended in divorce</strong></h4><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Jukebugs.com</a> was able to find 2 accounts that explain why the estranged couple split up. John began by outlining how their competing schedules were primarily to blame. Also, John claimed that Betsey was always working and frequently spent weeks in either San Francisco or Los Angeles, where her factories were located.</p><p>He further said that he came to realize their career paths were so divergent and they live in completely different worlds. For John, Betsey seemed able to pass in and out of his world with ease, but he could not negotiate hers. For this reason, he got lonely and would usually find someone else.</p><p>On the other hand, Betsey said their marriage was affected by John’s excessive drug use. According to her, she started going to work every day wondering if he’d be alive when she got home, and the stress of all that uncertainty began to take its toll on her. Also, she said that she was a night person and she was the girl who was at work every morning at 8:30 a.m. sharp.</p><p>Although the estranged lovers got divorced in 1969, Betsey has said she and John remain great friends and he’s still her favorite husband.</p><h4><strong>John Cale later got clean and moved on with other partners</strong></h4><p>Cale later got clean and now cautions against heroin addiction. He met Cynthia “Cindy” Wells, also referred to as Miss Cinderella or Miss Cindy of the GTOs, in 1971 and got married soon afterward only to divorce in 1975.</p><p>He also married Risé Irushalmi, his third wife, on December 6th, 1981. Eden Cale was their only child together, but in 1997, Cale experienced another divorce.</p><h4><strong>Betsey still relates well with John despite being estranged for so many years</strong></h4><p class=mol-para-with-font>When asked if she was still in touch with her ex-husband John in 2011, Betsey responded in the affirmative and spoke highly of their relationship. According to her, they come in and out of other’s lives, but no matter how many years go by, when they connect, it’s 1968. She also said he’s constantly as frantic and active as she is and sometimes she thinks out of all her boyfriends and husbands and he was the best one.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jeffrey_Oliviere></span><strong>Jeffrey Oliviere</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Betsey then went on to wed Jeffrey Oliviere in 1981, but they also got a divorce in 1984. The reason for the couple’s divorce has not been made public but is alleged by sources to be a result of irreconcilable differences.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brian_Reynolds></span><strong>Brian Reynolds</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After her relationship with Jeffrey went south, Betsey moved on to tie the knot with Brian Reynolds in 1997, and the two are still married to date. Not much is in the public space about Brian but in addition to<a href=# rel=noopener> being a fashion designer,</a> his wife is also an actress, known for Jane by Design (2012),&nbsp;Clueless (1996),&nbsp;and&nbsp;Point&Shoot (2004).</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Jacklyn Zeman Husbands: Meet The Men She Married And Kids</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=All_You_Should_Know_about_Her_Kids></span><strong>All You Should Know about Her Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Betsey learned she would soon become a mother at age 33, her relationship with the child’s father, whom she refers to only as Joe, was already in shambles. She later gave birth to her daughter, Lulu, and also brought her up all by herself.</p><p>Additionally, she committed to take a break from client meetings to tend to her in the restroom. She claimed to attend to business first, but she was constantly cuffed to her hip.</p><p>Her 46-year-old daughter now has two daughters of her own and lives near her mother in Malibu.</p><p>Meanwhile, at age 57 when Betsey discovered she had breast cancer, She continued to work during treatment and told no one except her daughter. The fashion artist said she had her boobs done and one day she woke up and the left one was gone, deflated overnight. According to Betsey, that saved her, because she found this pea-sized lump in her breast.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was concerned that it was displaying weakness and that if word got out, no one would buy her fabric. She didn’t know a single fashion businesswoman with cancer out of all the ladies she knew. In those days, nobody discussed it. But nine months later, she broke the taboo when she spoke up at a fashion show about her experience. According to her, the audience was incredibly supportive.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kr6bA0p6wZqKfnbu0u82sZKGto5eur7DSZqSenaRiuqa6jKyfnmWdlr%2BztcSdZJqmlGK1pr6MpKCdq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
