These official forms, which are unique to each individual sorority, are provided by the national organization for their alumnae members to fill out on behalf of potential new members. Please note that each sorority has its own policy as to whether or not they require a recommendation/reference and that the MSU Panhellenic does NOT have access to individual sorority Recommendation/Reference Forms.</p><p>A letter of recommendation is a form filled out by an alumna of a sorority on behalf of a potential new member and generally speaks about your character and verifies accomplishments, grades, and activities you are involved in. The alumna should refer to the national website of her affiliation for more information on these forms, as they vary from sorority to sorority. You will not know if a chapter receives your letter of recommendation but must trust the alumna you have asked to write your letter of recommendation. If you send her a thank you note promptly; it may help remind her. Recommendation letters generally need to be received by the chapters no later than August 1.</p><h3 class="text-maroon-300 my-3">Delta Gamma</h3><h3 class="text-maroon-300 my-3">Delta Delta Delta</h3><p>Mail address: Tri Delta P.O.
