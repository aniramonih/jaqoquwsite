Net Worth, Salary, Career</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-24</div><p><strong>T’yanna Wallace,</strong> a fashion designer, recently posted a one-million-dollar bail for her boyfriend Tyshawn Baldwin, who was arrested on August 16 and charged with 17 felony counts in connection with a hit-and-run earlier this month.&nbsp;On August 10, Tyshawn Baldwin was pulled over in Queens for a regular check by law enforcement officers, who requested him to get out of the vehicle after finding that his driver’s license had been suspended. Baldwin instead accelerated and smashed into three people, including a woman and her baby. All of the victims were seriously injured. He faces a plethora of accusations, including illegal escape from police, reckless endangerment, and endangering the welfare of a kid.</p><p>T’yanna Wallace, Baldwin’s girlfriend and the daughter of famed rapper The Notorious B.I.G., bailed him out of prison, according to court filings. According to court documents, Wallace put up her $1.5 million Brooklyn home to guarantee Baldwin’s release. T’yanna Wallace has a net worth of $20 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Tyanna-Wallace-1.jpg alt="T'yanna Wallace" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Everything we know about T’yanna Wallace Wealth</h2><p>Wallace, the daughter of Notorious B.I.G. and Jan Jackson, did not follow in her father’s footsteps and instead launched her own clothing brand, Notoriouss. She founded Notoriouss in May 2013, and she successfully juggled her brand obligations with her academics at Penn State before opening her own boutique in Brooklyn.</p><p>Wallace supposedly has a flair for fashion since high school. In an iHeart Radio interview, she explained her motivation for creating a company inspired by her late father:</p><p>“My degree was commerce, and then during my sophomore year, I realized I really wanted to create a clothing brand and do something committed and inspired by my father.” So that’s how the name Notoriouss came about, and it’s also how I launched my apparel business right out of college.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Tyanna-Wallace-2.jpg alt="T'yanna Wallace" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Every year on March 9, Notorious B.I.G. publishes a limited-edition t-shirt to commemorate Biggie’s death. Wallace explained how the Notorious B.I.G. vocalist affected the designs:</p><p>“I wanted to do something to honor his legacy, but I don’t perform music, so that wasn’t going to happen.” So I wanted to produce something that would keep his name alive while still including myself.”</p><p>Despite the fact that Christopher “Biggie Smalls” Wallace was slain at the age of 24, the rapper allegedly made certain that his daughter was cared for. T’yanna’s mother, Jan Jackson, said on Hot 97 in 2012:</p><p>“T’yanna has a trust fund set up for her schooling to ensure that everything goes as planned by her father.”</p><p>Much of the hip hop heiress’ riches seems to be founded on this “trust fund,” as well as revenues from her fashion line and social media brand sponsorships, like as Instagram, where she has 224k followers.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmasqZa7r62MsJilpJGYsm66xK1ksKeiqbVuv8ClmKuxXZius7HEq2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
