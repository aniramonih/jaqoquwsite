We have been true partners and friends; we are a kickass team.</p><p>"And while we will no longer love each other as husband and as wife, we remain deeply committed to one another as partners and co-parents to the three most incredible kids we could ask for.</p><p>"It’s our greatest hope that this experience translates into raising empathetic, caring and open-minded children who learn to embrace their differences… and respect and appreciate that which makes others different, too."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jeff, meanwhile, went ahead and shared his side of this story on Scary Mommy.</p><p>Explaining that he knew he was gay for about the last "four or five years," he wrote the following:</p><p>"I always knew I was different, but when you meet your soulmate when you’re 18 years old – only five years older than my own daughter is now – and that person is a woman, you simply think ‘thank God then, I can’t be gay."</p><p>Jeff and Jill are parents to a nine-year old, an 11-year old and a 13-year old.</p><p>“One thing I’ll say about my own journey is this: What should have been an easy choice — a no brainer — was the hardest decision I’ve ever made,” <a href=#>Jeff also wrote</a>.</p><p>“Once I came to terms with the fact that I was gay, I figured I had two options:</p><p>I could die — either from my intentional neglect of my health and well-being, or perhaps from something even more tragic — leaving my children fatherless, or I could come out and hope that I remained surrounded by the love of my friends, family, wife and children."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>During an interview with the Today show on Friday, Jill talked about breaking the news to the kids.</p><p>She said her and Jeff’s 13-year-old daughter reacted with sympathy and even offered to hug her father, while their boys had more trouble with the announcement.</p><p>Jill said they have “weepy moments” but have still been “incredibly mature” given the situation.</p><p>"I have had probably 70 people message me or email me privately who are in the same situation," she said on Today, adding:</p><p>“This has been really good for me. For as many nasty comments as we get on the internet, every time I have put something out there that has made me feel super vulnerable or that was painfully honest, the response has always been amazing."</p><p>Scary Mommy has over 2.8 million Likes on Facebook.</p><p>It is a go-to website for parenting tales and advice.</p><p>Added Jeff in his Scary Mommy entry, focusing on what’s most important:</p><p>Our children are amazing. They are all digesting the information in their own ways, but, boy, are they all also showing their true colors.</p><p>Brush away all of the worst characteristics and idiosyncrasies one would expect from kids their ages, and we’re left with compassionate, thoughtful, wonderful children.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WAcLbIpaNmq52kuK2x0WaqnJmirnquu8ymsGaanKS0qLHRZpinpp%2Bqu6Sx0maboq6fp7CmecaasGagpaivorrDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
