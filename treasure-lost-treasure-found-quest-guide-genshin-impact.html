You want to speak to Soraya about it, who can find to the west of the large ruins in the area. Soraya will talk to you about her curiosity about how many secrets Liyue holds, and the secrets specifically being the inscriptions on the Guili Assembly, which are the ruins she’s immediately next to when you find her. The quest is all about helping Soraya with her research on the location.</p><p data-injection=true>The first task is to go inside the Guili Assembly and search five stone tablets. A quick way to find all of their locations is to open up the quest menu, go to Treasure Lost Treasure Found, and click navigate on the bottom. Clicking this brings up the areas you can find these tablets, making it significantly easier to find them. After you find them all in this location, return to Soraya. She can share all of the translations made at each of the tablets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/29123339/Guili-Assembly-850x414.jpg><p data-injection=true>Next, you have to go to the west, next to the Luhua Pool to search for two more stone tablets. Similar to last time, you can use the navigation assistance to locate the area the two tablets are resting. However, because you had it on at the beginning of the quest, it should still be on. These two objects are much further apart. The first one is near Luhua Pool, and the next is to the south of the Guili Assembly. Again, return to Soraya once you have both.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/29123350/Luhua-Pool-850x408.jpg><h2>Jade Plate location 1</h2><p data-injection=true>Soraya wants to take some time to rest. Return to the Wangshu Inn, which should be north of your current position. Soraya then shares her findings and wants you to find four jade plates. These are not hidden all over the area. Luckily, the first one is not too far away from your location at the Wangshu Inn. It’s to the south, which you can reach by jumping off near Soraya and then gliding towards it. The location is guarded by several slimes that you must defeat before obtaining the plate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/29123412/First-Jade-Plate.jpg><h2>Jade Plate location 2</h2><p>The next jade plate is close to where you found the second stone tablets, over by Luhua Pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/29123357/Luhua-Pool-Jade-Plate.jpg><h2>Jade Plate location 3</h2><p>The third jade plate is to the south of the Guili Assembly, next to the waypoint for the area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/29123421/Assembly-Jade-Plate-850x458.jpg><h2>Jade Plate location 4</h2><p data-injection=true>The final jade plate is slightly northeast to the Guili Assembly area, right next to the Yaoguang Shoal. After you have all four jade plates, return to Soraya at the Wangshu Inn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/29123507/Guili-Plains-Jade-Plate.jpg><p data-injection=true>You now need to find the final ruin for the quest. Its exact location remains a mystery, but we’ve helped narrow it down for you. It’s to the north of the Guili Assembly, right in the middle of the Guili Plains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/29123451/Guili-Plains-777x480.jpg><p>You have to fight three Ruin Guards when you arrive after activating the stone at the center, so you can expect to spend some time dealing with them. After defeating them, return to Soraya to complete the quest and earn your rewards.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
