通称”ジュディマリ”と呼ばれることが多いです。
1993年にメジャーデビューを果たし、その後に一度の活動休止を挟んで2001年に解散を発表しました。
現在でも楽曲は人気で、動画サイトや音楽サービスサイトでは圧倒的な再生数を誇り、ジュディマリが活躍していた時代には産まれていなかった若者にも認知されています。
解散してからずっと再結成が望まれるバンドでもあります。
今日はジュディマリが解散してしまった理由、そしてメンバーの現在について書いてみたいと思います。
又、再結成の可能性や、再結成が難しい理由についても書いてみます。
JUDY AND MARYの解散までの経緯。バンドの構想は恩田快人が作った JUDY AND MARYはリーダーでベースの恩田快人さんを中心に活動開始しました。
“Judy And Mary”というバンド名は、快活でポジティヴな女のコ“ジュディ”とすこしひねくれ者のネガティヴな女のコ“マリー”という女の子の二面性を表しております。
恩田さんは昔から『女のコが歌うポップで切ないサウンドをバンドでやる』と決めており、ひょんなことで出会ったYUKIさんがそのイメージにハマったことで、ビジョンが動き出したのです。
1991年6月 YUKIと恩田快人が出会う。同年中に共にバンドを結成することを決める。 1992年2月 ジュディマリの構想が固まる。 1992年4月 インディーズアルバムをリリースしライブを決行 1992年11月 サポートメンバーであった五十嵐公太が正規メンバーとして加入するも、同年中にはバンドは解散状態。 1993年2月 ギターが藤田奏司に代わりTAKUYAが加入。ジュディマリのオリジナルメンバーが完成する。 1993年9月 メジャーデビュー 1994年12月 セカンドアルバムがオリコン2位を記録 1995年6月 TAKUYA作曲の「Over Drive」が計60万枚を突破しバンド初のヒット曲 恩田快人さんとYUKIさん中心になって始まったジュディマリですが、実は恩田さんはこのバンドで本腰に活動を続けるつもりはありませんでした。
そもそもYUKIさんが”バンド活動をしたいけど何して良いかわからない”という状態の時に出会い、自分と組んできっかけを作り、別の形でYUKIさんが売れてくれたら良いと考えていたのです。
1992年にインディーズアルバムを出してライブをした後は、”実質、解散状態”だったのです。
ジュディマリはヒットを連発するも99年活動休止→00年YUKI結婚→01年解散 友達バンドではなく、YUKIさんもTAKUYAさんも商業的な誘いから加入しており、２人共他メンバーとは約ひと回り年下です。
1993年にメジャデビューし、”初めてのヒット曲”は95年のTAKUYAさん作曲の「Over Drive」でした。
その後にはYUKIさんのカリスマ性で人気に火が付き、オリコン1位を連発し、ジュディマリ＝YUKIのイメージが強く付き纏いました。
1998年に２度目の紅白歌合戦に出場した後、”充電期間”として約1年間の活動休止を発表しています。
2000年の活動再開の後はベストアルバムが200万枚突破し、同年にはYUKIさんが結婚。
翌年2001年に全国紙朝刊の全面広告で解散を発表。同年にラストシングルとアルバムをリリースし、3月8日の東京ドームライブを最後に解散しました。
ジュディマリが解散した理由は恩田とメンバーの確執。TAKUYA、YUKIの急成長と恋人関係 ジュディマリは2001年の3月で解散しました。
当初から、解散の理由は恩田さんと一部メンバーの確執にあると言われていました。
ジュディマリはリーダーの恩田さんが構想を作りましたが、年下コンビのTAKUYAさんとYUKIさんの成長が著しく、バンド内でのパワーバランスが狂ってしまったのが原因だとされています。
TAKUYAさんの曲の評判が良く、活動後半の楽曲はほとんどがTAKUYAさんが作曲していました。
ジュディマリのバンドテーマはあくまで、ポジティヴな女のコ“ジュディ”とネガティヴな女のコ“マリー”の二面性でしたが、TAKUYAさんの力強さから”ジュディ”ばかりが全面に出るようになってしまったのです。
また、YUKIさんのカリスマ性の凄まじさは想定外で、作詞作曲などで揉めることが増え、恩田さんがバンドをコントロールできない状態になっていたのです。</description></item><item><title>10 Things You Didnt Know about Jon-Michael Ecker</title><link>/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-jon-michael-ecker-html.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-jon-michael-ecker-html.html</guid><description>Spread the love&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

The use of pool sand as a filter may be highly successful, but it is also rather expensive. Play sand and pool sand, on the other hand, are not the same thing and cannot be used interchangeably.
In a similar vein, one would wonder what sort of sand can be used in a pool filter.</description></item><item><title>Chris Nunez Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</title><link>/chris-nunez-net-worth-2020-2021.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/chris-nunez-net-worth-2020-2021.html</guid><description>Celebrated Name: Chris Nunez Real Name/Full Name: Chris Nuñez Gender: Male Age: 51 years old Birth Date: 11 April 1973 Birth Place: Miami Beach, Florida, United States Nationality: American Height: 1.75&amp;nbsp;m Weight: 65 kg Sexual Orientation: Straight Marital Status: Married Wife/Spouse (Name): Carole-Anne Leonard Children: Yes (Andreanne Núñez) Dating/Girlfriend</description></item><item><title>CNN Addresses Andy Cohens NYE 2021 Drunken Rant</title><link>/andy-cohen-cnn-html.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/andy-cohen-cnn-html.html</guid><description>Andy Cohen had an interesting start to 2022.
