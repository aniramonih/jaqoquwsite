To date, the exact date when she was born has not been revealed, and as a result, her zodiac sign can not be determined. Similarly, her birthplace has been kept secret, but reports indicate that she was born in America.</p><p>Shelly Tresvant is of African American ethnicity and holds an American nationality. The names of her parents and her siblings cannot be determined, as her family background remains unknown. Nothing is known about the early life of Ralph Tresvant’s ex-wife. Based on this, she did not reveal where she was raised.</p><p>Information regarding her education is scarce. In this vein, the names and locations of her basic and high schools are unclear. Shelly Tresvant’s degree status is unknown because the college she attended and her course of study was kept private.</p><h2><strong>She Started Dating Ralph Tresvant in 1979 and They Wed in 1993</strong></h2><p>According to the available reports, Shelly Tresvant and her ex-husband, Ralph Tresvant, started dating when she was just 11 years old. We believe that Ralph was also a few years older than her. Practically, they were childhood sweethearts even before they knew what a relationship was all about.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Shelly-Tresvant-and-Ralph-Tresvant.jpg alt width=696 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Running a brief trace on when they started dating following the available reports, It was stated that they dated for 14 years before exchanging their vows in 1993. This means that Shelly and the R&B singer started dating in 1979.</p><p>The couple had a very sweet wedding ceremony, which family and friends witnessed. At this period, Shelly Tresvant was already famous as a result of her husband’s fame as the lead singer of the group New Edition.</p><h2><strong>Their Marriage Lasted Only Three Years&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Shelly Tresvant was married to the R&B singer for just three years before they decided to call it a quit in 1996. It was reported that the couple started having internal issues that pointed to infidelity on the part of her husband. In the report, Ralph was having affairs with Amber Serrano when he was still married to Shelly. They decided to divorce, which made it much easier for Ralph to continue his relationship with Amber Serrano, whom he later married.</p><p>Although Ralph never reacted to the claims, his son once disclosed that his father didn’t cheat during his marriage with his mother. He claimed that his parents decided to split for reasons that he didn’t disclose.</p><h2><strong>Shelly Tresvant has Reportedly Struggled with Drug and Alcohol Addiction</strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Ralph-Tresvant-Wife-Shelly..png alt width=696 height=417 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></h2><p>According to rumors, Shelly’s divorce had a negative impact on her, leading to her excessive use of alcohol and cocaine. To a large extent, this claim wasn’t seen as totally true, as some believed that she must have been an addict even before her separation from the singer. According to the rumor, Shelly Tresvant had been arrested by the police for alcohol and drug abuse.</p><p>Shelly Tresvant’s son, Ralph Tresvant Jr., confirmed that his mother was once an addict but that she is gradually recovering. A report also stated that she was once arrested for probation violation. Meanwhile, no report clarifies if she has gotten over her alcohol and drug addiction.</p><h2><b>She has also Been Rumored to be Homeless at Some Point&nbsp;</b></h2><p>Among the rumors that followed Shelly Tresvant after her divorce from her ex-husband is that she once became homeless in Atlanta. However, there was no proof of this claim. But on the other hand, it was believed that there were still negative effects that come with drug addiction. This includes bankruptcy, which can result in being homeless.</p><p>Meanwhile, Shelly Tresvant has never reacted to these claims, nor has she openly declared herself homeless in Atlanta. Since any source does not yet confirm it, we are waiting for Ralph’s ex-wife to confirm or reject this claim.</p><h2><strong>Shelly Welcomed Three Children With Her Ex Husband</strong></h2><p>Before Shelly Tresvant and her ex-husband lost the chemistry in their marriage, they welcomed three children. Here is all about the three children of Shelly Tresvant and her ex-husband.</p><h3><strong>Na’Quelle Ladawn Tresvant</strong></h3><p>Na’Quelle is the first child and the eldest daughter of Shelly Tresvant. She was born in California on the 9th of June 1990. Na’Quelle is a model, singer, and lyricist who has made a mark in the entertainment industry. In 2010, she released her first successful EP, Beautiful, before she moved on to release other songs, including Leave Lonely in 2015 and many more.</p><p>Na’Quelle is currently married to Darius King D. Smith. Her husband, Darius, is a music producer and also her music producer. Na’Quelle, along with her husband, is the owner of Kingland R&T Music Group. The couple has so far welcomed two children, who are automatically Shelly’s grandchildren.</p><h3><strong>Mariah Tresvant</strong></h3><p>Maria Tresvant is the second daughter of Shelly and Ralph Tresvant. Her exact year of birth remains uncertain, but a source stated that she was born on September 12, 1995. She should be 28 years old if the date of birth is correct. Maria, just like her mother, prefers to stay out of the limelight.</p><p>Nothing is known about her personal life as she decides to live a life outside her father’s fame. What she does for a living has not been disclosed. However, she is passionate about modeling, designing, fashion, and dancing. She shuffles her time between her mother and her father and has maintained a good relationship with them.</p><h3><strong>Ralph Tresvant Jr.</strong></h3><p>Ralph Tresvant is the only son of Shelly Tresvant. Like his mother, he also tries to keep his personal life separate from his professional life. Nothing is known about his date of birth, making it impossible to determine his age.</p><p>He is a pop singer, even though he is famously known as Ralph Tresvant’s first son. The pop singer is highly motivated by his father, who is a legendary R&B singer and songwriter. Ralph Tresvant Jr. maintains a very close relationship with his half-brother, Dakari, as they are often spotted together taking snapshots.</p><h2><span><strong>Where is Ralph Tresvant’s Ex-wife Now?</strong></span></h2><p>Shelly has, over time, been a personality that avoids the media. This has made it impossible to be sure of where she is currently. However, some sources have disclosed that she is in Atlanta and lives a tranquil lifestyle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdqLWmuMuyZK2qlajDorrTZpilpF2Wr7DB02apmqSgnXq1vsSsrZqmpKh6uLXFnmSappRitaa%2BjKyYnWWglsC1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
