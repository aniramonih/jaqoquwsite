The Oscar-winning actor was being interviewed by Inside Edition the morning of Thursday, Aug. 28, when <a href=#>the news of Brangelina’s wedding broke</a>.</p><p>CBS’&nbsp;Inside Edition asked Voight, 75, about the wedding at around 7:30 a.m. PT, several hours after the A-list couple’s spokesperson confirmed to the AP that Jolie and Pitt were married in France, Saturday, Aug. 23. Voight responded by saying he did not know they got married.</p><p>Asked whether he had a comment, Voight quipped: “That’s nice.”</p><p>He added to Us Weekly on Thursday,&nbsp;“It seems like it was very nice —&nbsp;and with all of the kids involved, it must have been a lot of fun and very beautiful. I’m happy for them.”</p><p>While Voight is happy for the couple, he hasn’t had a chance to wish them congratulations yet. “I haven’t spoken [to them since they got married],” he tells Us. “No, I didn’t know it was happening —&nbsp;it was Emmys week, so I wasn’t able to go.”</p><p>Voight was 5,700 miles away all weekend attending <a href=#>pre-Emmys and Emmys events</a> for his work on Showtime series, Ray Donovan.</p><p>Voight’s contentious relationship with Jolie, 39, his daughter with the late <strong>Marcheline Bertrand</strong>, has been well chronicled in the past. The two reconciled in early 2010 after years of estrangement. In June, Voight <a href=#>praised his granddaughter <strong>Vivienne’</strong>s acting debut</a> in her mom’s blockbuster hit Maleficent. “Magnificent. She’s wonderful,” he told Us of the 6-year-old’s big-screen debut as young Princess Aurora.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He added that Vivienne’s appearance reminded him of when Jolie first made her debut alongside him in 1982 comedy, Lookin’ to Get Out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>This is not the first time Jolie kept a top-secret plan from her father. The star, who underwent a preventative double mastectomy in early 2013, similarly <a href=#>kept her father out of the loop</a>. Voight, like millions of readers, found out about his daughter’s procedure after she penned an op-ed for the New York Times about her bold medical decision.</p><p>Still, the actor gushed about his famous daughter an interview with the Daily News in May 2013. “My love and admiration for my daughter can’t be explained in words,” Voight, also the father to Jolie’s brother<strong> James Haven</strong>, said. “I was as surprised as anyone and deeply moved by the way she’s handled this,” he continued of her thoughtful essay. “She’s a very extraordinary person, the way she examined it and what she shared.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGopl2rvKqzx61knaGUo8Fut82ormaZkqTCtXnAp56epJmjrm62zqWgnmWSp66lec%2Biq62rXayypbDIp55mamBmgXOElw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
