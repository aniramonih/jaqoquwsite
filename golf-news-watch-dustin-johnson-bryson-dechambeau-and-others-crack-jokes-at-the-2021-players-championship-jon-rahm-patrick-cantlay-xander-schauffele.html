In fact, Jimmy Fallon has been doing this segment with tour pros for a few years now.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Here’s how it works: These players are asked to utter a random phrase that should be added to one of their replies during an official press conference. Some of the lines from this year were just hilarious!</span></p><p><span>The humor element is triggered when these PGA tour guys add the given sentence when talking about something serious. Here’s what some of them said in 2021 as part of the</span><i><span> ‘Drop It In’</span></i><span> segment:</span></p><p><b>Jon Rahm:</b><span> Simple Truth is, we have the meats.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Dustin Johnson:</b><span> I’ve never been known to skip on the dip.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Bryson DeChambeau:</b><span> I love putting.
