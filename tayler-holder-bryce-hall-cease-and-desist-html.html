There were speculations he was involved in unspecified sexual assault allegations. But no one was willing to talk about it as they were sent a cease and desist letter.
TikTok’s bad boy, however, was not willing to take the warning seriously.

And then, a few weeks later, Hall said he wanted to fight Holder in a <a href=# rel=follow>boxing match</a>, but only if he explained why he sent out the cease and desist letters.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But it looks like Holder has&nbsp;had enough of Hall’s online antics and finally retaliated.&nbsp;On July 28, the former Sway Boy tweeted&nbsp;he got another cease and desist letter.&nbsp;</p><p>“Awhh, @taylorholdsballs sent me another cease and desist letter. He really doesn’t want something getting out. I hope he doesn’t sue me,” wrote Hall.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He then followed it up with another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a>: “I’ve realized that I’m the only thing keeping that rat somewhat relevant… instead of making these things public. I’ll handle this situation offline. Enjoy the show as it unravels.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>It is unconfirmed what he meant by “enjoy the show as it unravels,” but fans think he is working to&nbsp;bring the truth to the public.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Bryce Hall Mocks Tayler Holder in a TikTok Video</h2><p>Hall also uploaded a TikTok titled “guys, I am not lonely” and mocked Holder as he always did.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The TikToker stitched a fan edit that saw him doing a dance trend with <a href=# rel=follow>his former girlfriend</a>, Addison Rae, and Holder in the first part of the clip.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the second part of the clip, he was dancing alone. The clip then cut&nbsp;to Hall saying, “wait, why is that like....” and then let out a fake sob.&nbsp;</p><p>The video has been viewed over 10 million times, a far cry from his average of 3&nbsp;million. His fans appreciated his sarcastic humor and commented that the video was funny.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyRrrmmvoyhpqWclad6o77YnJxmoJGhuW6vxJqqnmWRo7FusMSsoKysXp3Brrg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
