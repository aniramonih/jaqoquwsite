The former athlete, who played for different teams, is the Chicago Bulls vice president of basketball operations at the moment. When he was a student at Notre Dame University, he was an All-American.</p><p>John’s professional career hasn’t been the only one to be prosperous. He has been happily married to Carolyn Paxson for some time. He has remained in the public eye for a long time, so many people must be interested to learn about his marriage. Therefore, this little article on John Paxson’s wife and some facts about her are provided here.</p><h2><span id=Relationship>Relationship</span></h2><p>Carolyn Paxson, John Paxson’s wife, was previously mentioned. The couple’s marriage must have been consummated quite some time ago. Information on the couple’s wedding, however, is also scarce because they haven’t divulged anything about how they met or how their relationship started. However, with friends and families in attendance, it must have been a wonderful private celebration.</p><p>Over the years, the couple’s marriage has become stronger than ever. We can only hope that the Paxson pair will provide more information about their union very soon. They received two children at once</p><p>As was said earlier, Carolyn and John must have been wed for several years. Throughout their partnership, the couple welcomed two children.</p><p>The oldest kid of John Paxson and Carolyn was born in <strong>1986</strong>. His name is Ryan Paxson. Their youngest child, Drew Paxson, has never had his birth details made public. The children of John and Carolyn Paxson are now grownups who are working at their respective jobs.</p><p>Since <strong>August 2021</strong>, Ryan, a Marine, has served as a sergeant instructor at Quantico, Virginia. Drew, on the other hand, is an assistant in business operations for the Chicago Bulls. Overall, the advancement of their sons must delight Carolyn and her husband.</p><h2><span id=One_of_the_four_children_of_her_parents>One of the four children of her parents</span></h2><p>John Paxson’s wife, Carolyn Ziehler, was born. She was welcomed by Grace Marilyn and John Robert Ziehler. She was raised in her hometown along with her siblings Maryellen Hause, Robert Joseph Ziehler, and Margaret Ziehler. Sadly, Carolyn’s siblings Robert and Margaret are already dead.</p><p>Additionally, Carolyn Paxson’s father once owned Producers Oil Company. Sadly, he died away on <strong>January 30, 2016</strong>. Four months later, sorrow struck again on <strong>May 3, 2016</strong>, when her beloved mother passed suddenly. She must have found it difficult to cope with her parent’s sudden passing. But life goes on no matter what occurs, so she must be doing well now.</p><p>The Dayton Daily News reports that John Paxson’s spouse attended Alter High. Apart from that, she has kept her educational and professional history a secret.</p><h2><span id=Carolyn_Paxson_and_John_sold_their_home>Carolyn Paxson and John sold their home</span></h2><p>In <strong>November 2019</strong>, the couple paid <strong>$725,000</strong> for their Lake Bluff residence. The couple sold the home after nearly three decades of ownership and made a 10% profit. In <strong>December 2018</strong>, the couple also placed an advertisement for their home for <strong>$1.08 million</strong>, which is <strong>$137,222</strong> less than the original purchase price in today’s money.</p><p>The couple then decreased the price from<strong> $1,099,900</strong> to<strong> $999,900</strong> and finally to <strong>$979,000</strong> in late May. The price was subsequently steadily lowered throughout the summer, reaching <strong>$799,000</strong> in August—a 33 percent discount from the original asking price. In the end, they received <strong>$725,000</strong> for it.</p><p>Furthermore, the house cost the couple <strong>$650,000</strong> in <strong>1991</strong>, which is comparable to <strong>$1.22 million</strong> now. The five-bedroom, six-bath home, which is 5,200 square feet in size and was built in <strong>1990</strong>, also has other features.</p><p>Additionally, Mrs. Paxson comes out as humble despite being in the spotlight. She isn’t very active on social media and hasn’t disclosed many personal details about herself there. However, Carolyn must be doing just well. We hope she has a lot more joyful days ahead.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Steven Krueger Girlfriend, Gay, Net Worth</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity wife</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Clive Myrie Wife Illness: What Happened To Catherine Myri?
