The blonde actress joined her other half at the Annual Brazil Foundation Gala Party at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The couple welcomed their first child together on July 15 but are yet to reveal the name of the new arrival. Uma is also mum to Maya, 13, and Levon, 10, with her ex-husband <a class=hm-link href=#>Ethan Hawke</a>. Forty-nine year old financier Arpad has two sons - Arpad Flynn Alexander, 14, and Aurelius Cy Andrea, nine – from his relationship with model <a class=hm-link href=#>Elle Macpherson</a>. Arpad won over one of Hollywood's most enigmatic blondes back in 2007. Apart from a brief split in 2009, the pair have been inseparable ever since. Uma credits him with the happiness and contentment that she has found in life. "I have something I would really like to express about my love life," she announced during an interview with Harper's Bazaar. "I'm happier with it now than I've been in many, many years. I’m trying to have as peaceful a personal life as possible."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
