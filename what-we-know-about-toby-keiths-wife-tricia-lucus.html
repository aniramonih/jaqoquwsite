The two told <a href=#>People</a> in 2001 that they met at a club when he was just 20 and she was 19, years before the former became one of the most prominent stars in country music. In fact, at the time, Keith was earning $50,000 a year working at an oil-field and would play shows in bars in his free time while Lucas was a secretary. She clearly felt an instant attraction to Keith, though. "He was just one of those larger-than-life guys, full of confidence," she recalled, while he told <a href=#>Country Weekly</a> in 2011 they shared a dance that fateful night they met. "I thought she was great," he added. The two ended up dating for three years before walking down the aisle, though things weren't always the easiest before Keith made it big in the music world.</p><p>"Dozens of people told Tricia, 'You need to go tell your old man to get a real job.' It took a strong-hearted and loving woman to say, 'He's good enough at music that I've got to let him try. And it'll be a great shot for both of us if he can make it work,'" Keith admitted to Country Weekly of how his wife always supported his dream. Lucas told People, "He'd say, 'Trish, one of these days, my time is coming. Hang in there.'" And hang in she did.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamloZ316hI6wn5qsXayybrfNqK5mmZKkwrV506iZsmWbmra1tNJmrqKelWLBs7XCophmpKWYwrR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
