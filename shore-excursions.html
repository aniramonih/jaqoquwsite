Seattle comes by its nickname naturally, as the city and its environs are perpetually green. It’s surrounded by parks, forests, and mountains, and is set picture-perfect between Puget Sound and Lake Washington.</p><p>The marine setting beckons visitors to enjoy activities on the water and throughout the lively waterfront and you can book shore excursions before or after your <a href=#>Alaska cruise from Seattle</a> that offer everything from ferry rides across the Sound and sunset cruises aboard luxury yachts, to Aquarium visits to view marine mammal and Pacific coral reef exhibits. There are stretches of restaurants for every taste from picnic lunches to fine dining, with indoor and outdoor spaces to enjoy the food and the view.</p><p>For an unparalleled view of the city that comes with the thrill you can only get from a ride on a Ferris wheel, the Seattle Big Wheel is not to be missed. The Wheel towers over the waterfront and is almost as famous as the Space Needle.</p><p>And without a doubt, Seattle shore excursions that include a trip to the Observation Deck of the Space Needle, with or without a meal or drink at the revolving restaurant, are a must. And, booking a combo tour that includes a visit to <a href=#>Chihuly Garden and Glass</a> to revel in genius glassblower-artist Dale Chihuly’s fantastic and whimsical exhibits and lush gardens is your own kind of genius.</p><p>One of the most fascinating of Seattle cruise excursions combines a city tour with an opportunity to learn about the Northwest Coastal Native Tribe on a boating tour to Tillicum Village. The village, accessible only by boat, is located on Blake Island, where visitors are treated to a buffet feast of salmon roasted on cedar stakes; a native dance performance, film and storytelling follows.</p><p>Intrepid food explorers will love an opportunity to revel in the sights, smells, and sounds of the Pike Place Market, the oldest continuously operated public market in the U.S. Visitors flock to this extraordinary market as much for the incredible variety of its fresh-from-the-sea fish and seafood, as for the amazing sing-song banter and fish-throwing routines found at Flying Fish, one of the market’s oldest vendors. In addition to an amazing fruits and vegetables, breads and cheeses, you’ll find many ethnic food stands, and an array of artisan handicrafts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSusLPByKycrGaTpLpwtc2tZqmnoqnAcL%2FEmqutpJVkwKm70Z5knrCTqr%2B0tc6nqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
