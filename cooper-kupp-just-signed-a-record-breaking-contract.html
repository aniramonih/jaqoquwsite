The deal includes $75 million guaranteed, which is more guaranteed money than any NFL wide receiver has ever been given. In total, Kupp now has five years and $110 million remaining on his contract.</p><p>Kupp <a href=# rel=noopener>confirmed the news in a tweet</a>, saying he was grateful for his first five years and telling fans he's "even more excited by our future."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-333951 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1370413816.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-333951 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images</p><p>The 28-year-old receiver had a breakout campaign last year. He led the league with 145 receptions for 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns, becoming just the fourth player since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to lead the league in catches, yards, and touchdowns. Kupp continued his torrid pace in the playoffs, hauling in two touchdowns in the Super Bowl.</p><p>Kupp told reporters earlier in the week that he wasn't looking to reset the market for wide receivers. He said he didn't want to try and overtake deals like <a href=# rel=noopener>the one the Miami Dolphins gave Tyreek Hill</a>, a deal that made Hill the highest-paid wide receiver in the league.</p><p>Kupp's extension is the latest offseason move for the reigning Super Bowl champs. The team reworked <a href=# title="Aaron Donald Net Worth">Aaron Donald</a>'s contract, making the defensive tackle the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. The Rams also extended quarterback <a href=# title="Matthew Stafford Net Worth">Matthew Stafford</a>'s contract and signed wide receiver Allen Robinson II and linebacker <a href=# title="Bobby Wagner Net Worth">Bobby Wagner</a>.</p><p>Robinson will likely fill the role played by wide receiver Robert Woods, who was traded to the Tennessee Titans in March. Kupp and Woods were a strong one-two punch for several years; after Woods tore his ACL midway through the 2021 season, Kupp had even more opportunities to shine — and he capitalized on them.</p><p>Now, Kupp's new focus is earning another Super Bowl ring. And with the way things look in Los Angeles, that's not a far-fetched thought at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpymqKiVp3qswc%2BpZKOto6l6tLXGp5ydZZFiv6avzqubZpqimq6stc2gZJynnqm%2Foq%2FTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
