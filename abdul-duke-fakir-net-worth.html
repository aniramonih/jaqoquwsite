The pair then met up with Lawrence Payton and Renaldo "Obie" Benson in 1954 when they were attending a friend's birthday party. It was at this point that they banded together in order to create "The Four Aims," which was later changed to the Four Tops. They went on to become one of the most well known Motown singing quartets and helped set the sound for music ventures throughout the 1960s. Many of their songs are still known today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZK6jsNSlZJ2tm5p6p63KoqlmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
