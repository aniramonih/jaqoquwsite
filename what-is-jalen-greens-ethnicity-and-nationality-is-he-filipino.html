He has Filipino heritage from his motherâ€™s side of the family. As reported in various quarters, his mother, Bree Puruganan, through her grandfather, is of partial Filipino descent.</p><p>Other sources have it that Greenâ€™s mom was born and raised in&nbsp;Ilocos Sur, Philippines.&nbsp;Over the years, it has become clear that Jalen Green has Filipino heritage from his motherâ€™s side, which only makes up half of his ethnic background.</p><p>The other half has been subjected to speculations. This is because the identity of the NBA starâ€™s biological father is unknown to the public. While some reports speculate that the man might have passed on, others claim he has never been involved in Jalenâ€™s life.</p><p>However, based on the NBA starâ€™s physical looks, it has been widely upheld that his biological father is an African American. If this is true, then it means that Jalen Green is partly Filipino American and partly African American. Marcus Green, who is widely known as his father, is only his stepfather. Per reports, Marcus is an African American.</p><p>The Houston Rockets shooting guard seems to be more in touch with the Filipino side of his ethnic heritage.
