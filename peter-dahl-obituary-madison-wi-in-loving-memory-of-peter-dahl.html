The 4th child of Byron and Betsey Dahl. His three siblings remember standing on the pavement outside their mother’s hospital room window as she held newborn Peter for the first time. A farm near Kennedy, Minnesota, was Peter’s childhood playground. He graduated from Kennedy in 1978. He earned an AS from UMC in Crookston, MN. Peter began farming and helped his father Byron cultivate and harvest wheat and sugar beets. He took up farming once Byron retired. Peter</p><p>s life improved 20 years ago when he relocated to Belleville, Kansas. He joined a road-paving team after working on a dairy farm. He founded Peter Dahl Creations, refurbishing antique furniture. Father Byron taught him this trade, and he adored restoring old furniture. After falling from a ladder in 2015, Peter shattered multiple back and rib bones. His final three years were challenging and included six major surgery.</p><p>Peter shocked his doctors with his fortitude and humor in his final years. Love was stronger than his weak heart. His daughter Desiree Dahl Colombo, son Jeremy King, sisters Cynthia Maloney (Dan Maloney) and Nancy Dahl (Michael Hannon), and sister-in-law Vickie Dahl survive Peter. Many precious nieces and nephews and great nieces and nephews are his. His first and second cousins abound.</p><p>He leaves many Belleville friends who helped him in recent years. His naughty cat Tess has a decent home. Brother Conrad McCulloch Dahl and parents Betsey and Byron Dahl died before him. Services will be scheduled later. Keep Peter’s family in your prayers. Cynthia Maloney, Peter Dahl’s sister, accepts memorial donations at P.O. Box 421, Hallock, MN 56728. The Dahls are working with Tibbetts-Fischer Funeral Home.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwvMStnKtllJa1rXnOm6CtrZGnxm65wJ2grKeeYsSqecinZKWnpp67qHnMnqSoqqlivKd5z56rnqpdma6puI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
