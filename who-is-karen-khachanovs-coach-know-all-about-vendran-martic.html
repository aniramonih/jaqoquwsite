It also includes an incredible&nbsp;Paris Masters title from 2018. After reaching the quarterfinals of the 2019 French Open, he achieved his career-high singles ranking of World No. 8 in July that year. Khachanov began playing tennis at the age of three and decided to become a professional player at the age of twelve. In July 2013, he won the Under-18 European Championship in Switzerland. A year later&nbsp;at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics, he won a silver medal in doubles with Andrey Rublev. Even though&nbsp;they were defeated in the final by Brazilians Orlando Luz and Marcelo Zormann, the potential shown by both players has been clearly evident for others to see. They both have made a name for themselves in the tennis circuit and are still going strong.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Khachanov made his Davis Cup debut for Russia in 2013, and at the age of 17 years and 157 days, he surpassed Mikhail Youzhny as the youngest Russian tennis player in the pro series.&nbsp;He defeated South African Dean O’Brien to help Russia advance in the 2013 Davis Cup Europe/Africa Zone Group I. Khachanov took some time to settle in at the top level, but it was not long before he started to get the desired results.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>At the 2016 Chengdu Open, he finally had his watershed moment. He&nbsp;reached&nbsp;his first ATP Tour final, defeating&nbsp;Joao Sousa, Adrian Mannarino, Feliciano Lopez, and Victor Troicki. Thereby,&nbsp;Khachanov became the first Russian to reach an ATP singles final since Mikhail Youzhny, who defeated David Ferrer in the final of the 2013 Valencia Open 500. Khachanov eventually ended up&nbsp;winning&nbsp;his first ATP tournament in three sets, defeating Albert Ramos-Vinolas.</p><p>He carried his recent form into the 2017 French Open. After beating Nicolas Jarry, Tomas Berdych and John Isner, he reached the fourth round at a Grand Slam for the first time in his career. However, the Russian was unable to reach his first Grand Slam quarterfinal, losing to Andy Murray.&nbsp;</p><p>The following year turned out to be extra special for the 25-year-old player. He won his second ATP title at Open 13 in Marseille, France, in the first half of 2018. The Russian had registered some notable results that year. He entered the fourth round of Wimbledon and reached the semi-finals of a Masters 1000 tournament for the first time in his career, at the Canadian Open. Besides, Khachanov also helped Team Russia to progress through the 1st round play-off of the Europe/Africa Zone Group I by winning both matches and securing Russia a place in the World Group. His greatest triumph, however, came later in the year.</p><h2 id=h-know-all-about-karen-khachanov-s-coach><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-869 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Know all about Karen Khachanov’s coach</h2><p>Jose Clavet, who frequently trains with his former coach Vendran Martic, is Karen Kachanov’s current trainer. After breaking up with Vendran Martic in 2020 because of his form issues, he began dating Jose. Jose, a former tennis player from Spain, peaked at a career-high ranking of 178 in the singles category and 119 in the doubles. He started his coaching career after he stopped competing and has worked with many tennis players from Spain.</p><p>Before they split up in 1999, he spent many years serving as Francisco Clavet’s coach. Jose has also collaborated with people like Feliciano Lopez, Tommy Robredo, Fernando Verdasco, and Lex Corretja. The Spanish coach has played a significant role in Karen’s return to form because he won a championship in their first season and has excelled ever since, particularly on the international stage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqSoZpOkunDAxKeloqtfrLWwecisZKSZopq7brfHmpqhmZ6kw7R5wqiYnKBdoLuww4yao6VlkZe8tsCMr5ynnKKWu265wKuroptf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
