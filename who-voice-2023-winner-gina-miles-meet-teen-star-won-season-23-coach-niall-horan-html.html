'So I suggest maybe getting a goat. How about getting me because I'm a mountain goat. I'm Capricorn.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Blake had pushed his button over 600 times, coached more than 300 artists, worn 210 pairs of boots, and drunk 100 gallons of whatever is in this cup,' Carson announced, holding up Blake's cup and taking a sip. 'That is vodka in this cup. Blake, you have had a great run and just like any other GOAT when it's time to walk away from the game, throw in the towel, pack it in and call it a day, we commemorate this big moment!'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Carson announced they would retire Blake's jean jacket.

I'm going to make six of these videos,' Miley Cyrus, 30, said. 'Blake are you pulling an Elton?'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jennifer Hudson, Usher, Camila Cabello, John Legend and Pharrell Williams, also taped messages for Blake.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Twenty three seasons I don't even know how you could drink that much liquor,' said Usher, 44.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Blake it was such an honor to sit next to you for the seasons that I was at The Voice,' Miley said.

'You really stole the show, you really did. Congratulations on that and wish you the best of luck on whatever you decided to do next.
