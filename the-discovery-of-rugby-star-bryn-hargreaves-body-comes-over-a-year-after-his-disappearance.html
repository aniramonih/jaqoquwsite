However, the last time they spoke with him on January 3 last year, ‘he seemed fine.’</p><p>When officers arrived at his apartment in Morgantown in West Virginia, they discovered his door unlocked and his shower still running, with all his belongings, including his phone and Apple laptop, raising fears that he might have been abducted.</p><p>His brother Gareth posted on Facebook yesterday, announcing the news: ‘RIP Bryn Hargreaves. With incredible sadness, I can confirm after 14 months we have finally found Bryn.’</p><p>‘We still do not know the cause of death or what actually happened on 3/1/22. Thanks to all those that have helped in the search.’</p><p>His mother Maria Andrews also shared on social media: ‘Not something I wanted to be sharing. I’m in bits #heartbroken. My beautiful son Bryn. I can’t think of any words to describe the pain xx.’</p><p>A spokesman for the Monongalia County Sheriff’s Office mentioned that Bryn was reported missing to them on January 16.</p><p>Sniffer dogs were used to search the Cheat Lake area of Morgantown, but to no avail. Gareth mentioned at the time: ‘It’s almost like he was abducted from his shower.’</p><p>‘It’s certainly a fear of mine. Obviously, he was having mental health issues and was in severe pain due to a car accident in December.</p><p>‘I think the police thought he’d done something to himself, and that certainly is a possibility that we also fear. But five months later, surely a body would have turned up.’</p><p>‘It’s a bit strange if you wanted to disappear to leave your apartment unlocked with all your ID and some of your prized possessions.’</p><p>‘It’s one of the reasons I can’t leave this. If he’s had a rough time and had enough so he’s taken himself away, that’s fair enough.’</p><p>‘But if something has happened and we didn’t try to help or find him, I could never forgive myself.’</p><p>Bryn, from Wigan, made 175 appearances in the sport’s top flight, Super League, for Wigan Warriors, St Helens, and Bradford Bulls.</p><p>He retired from rugby at the young age of 26 after becoming disillusioned with the game and then moved to the US.</p><p>Bryn worked in the oil and gas industry and lived in Pittsburgh with his American wife, Amy, whom he met on holiday in Mexico in 2013.&nbsp;</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiroZ1dmba0r86vnKuxXaSzbr7UoJmyZaOprrN5wauwp2WYlr%2BovsSarZ6rXZe8pcWMnKamnaNivLex0WaYZrGVlr9urcWtnKtlmJ7AbrDIrJipqJWWv6K6wp5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
