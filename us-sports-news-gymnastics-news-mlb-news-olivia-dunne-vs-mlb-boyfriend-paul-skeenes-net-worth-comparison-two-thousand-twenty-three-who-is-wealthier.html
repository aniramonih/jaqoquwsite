With Dunne making the news almost every day for her <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>gymnastics</a> skills, there was no chance the couple could keep their romance a secret. Since <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>the lovebirds announced their relationship</a>, fans have expressed their joy for the young couple.</p><p>Both youngsters have gained popularity and fame in their respective sporting areas. With Olivia being America’s favorite right now, her legacy extends beyond LSU scholarships. The gymnastic queen has been acing some top deals. Recently she has featured in Forbes’ Top 50 social media influential honorees. Baseball player Paul Skenes, on the other hand, is a pitcher for the LSU Tigers and a finalist for the Gold Spikes Award 2023.&nbsp;As the two continue to make headlines, one question looms large. Who is the wealthier athlete between the two?</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Can Paul Skenes Match the Wealth of Her Lover?</h2><p>Olivia, or as many people like to call her, Livvy has a long list of impressive accomplishments to her name. She is a striking example of balancing sports with other activities. Making her debut in 2014 at the American Classics, Olivia has an estimated net worth of $2.3 million, owing to NCAA’s NIL Policy. The gymnast prodigy, besides her scholarships, earns most of her money from various brand deals, photoshoots, and social media posts. With her huge followers on both Instagram and TikTok, Livvy earns half a million dollars for a simple post, as revealed by the gymnast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Olivia-Dunne-Paul-Skenes.jpeg><p>On the other hand, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>according to a report by Sportzhive</a>, Paul Skenes has an estimated $3 million in his net worth. This includes his salary, endorsement contracts, and other sources of income. The pitcher has pitched 235 innings across 52 games over the course of three years. In such a short time, he has made his mark quite well! But With great power comes responsibility, something Paul knows very well. The young player donates a part of his income to charity as well. Overall, they appear to be the ideal match!</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Saved by $110 Million and Reunited With Olivia Dunne, Sports Illustrated Makes All the Waves With Gymnastics’ NIL Queen</a></p><p>Both the athletes have been using their social media accounts strategically well. While Paul has brands like Nike, Gatorade and Rawlings on the list of his endorsements, Dunne is no less! Livvy has partnered with brands like American Eagle, Forever 21, and Vuori. Additional noteworthy brand collaborations include CoverGirl, Revolve, and Lululemon. The homeschooled gymnast, as per reports, earns an annual income of “seven figures”. Both of them have advanced much in their own particular ways. But when did the pair officially declare their union?</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Paul and Olivia Declare Their Love</h2><p>With such a large fan base, the couple found it very difficult to conceal their affection for one another. Following several months of dating, the couple have officially declared their love for each other only recently. After three months of being together, the pair posted a sweet photo to Instagram, a testament to their bond.</p><p>Paul Skenes shared a photo on Instagram with Olivia Dunne at LSU’s home stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He had captioned the picture as, “Back in the boot!” Shortly after, fans were quick enough to point to Dunne’s reply to the post. Olivia wrote,” My heart!” The duo looked adorable together, as the image clearly demonstrated. Now that their relationship is official, Dunne may publicly express her affection for the baseball player.</p><p><strong>Watch this Story: </strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>After Discussing NIL Wealth with Sports Illustrated, Olivia Dunne Joins Best of Best at Forbes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9SsZKyon6fBtHnNnq6sZZeuuq%2Bt0q2gnKtdo7K4v4ymo5tlnprEtHnOpaCvoZFisba6zZ5kr6tdormjecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXnPmqylZaOgsqa6xKxkp52kYsSwvtOhZJynnaWus7XSqKVmrKekerW0zq6qmqaUYsG4sc2tsGasmKeypnnWoaZmoaNixKaty62fop2iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
