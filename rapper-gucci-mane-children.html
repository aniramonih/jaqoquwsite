Reportedly it is said that Gucci’s wife has three children whom she left in Jamaica to pursue her modeling career&nbsp;in the USA. Even the children of&nbsp;Keyshia Ka’Oir aren’t revealed yet. Maybe Gucci’s wife, Keyshia didn’t leak her children’s name because that could make a huge controversy in the media…who knows?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Gucci_Manes_Son_Lives_With_His_Baby_Mama_Sheena_Evans></span>Gucci Mane’s Son Lives With His Baby Mama, Sheena Evans<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The American rapper Gucci Mane has got name and fame in the world. Gucci and his baby mama, Sheena started dating in around 2004 and 2005. We are still unknown with the date when Gucci and Sheena split up. But Gucci had his son with Sheena Evans in 2007. Gucci Mane got to know about his only son, Keitheon only in 2016.</p><p>At the moment, Sheena has been taking care of her baby. After doing some analysis, Gucci Mane’s baby mama gets a certain amount of money as child&nbsp;support for taking the responsibility of Keitheon. So, looking at the fact we can assume that Sheena Evans got the custody for her child. Plus Gucci Mane has a net worth of $12 million.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by Gucci Mane (@laflare1017)</a> on Mar 24, 2019 at 6:53am PDT</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Gucci_Manes_Baby_Mama_relying_on_welfare></span>Gucci Mane’s Baby Mama relying on welfare<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As mentioned earlier, Sheena Evans gets a certain sum of money as child support from Gucci Mane. She <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">used to get $2076</a> as the child&nbsp;support when Gucci’s income was relatively low in 2011. Possibly it was not easy for Sheena to raise Gucci’s son with the money she was given.</p><p>But after sometimes, Gucci got back into new music projects and the reality gigs, his earnings touched the sky. When Sheena got familiar with that news she demanded $20,000 cash as child support. The reason behind that was an expensive marriage ceremony between Gucci Mane and his spouse, Keyshia Ka’Oir.</p><p>On the other hand, Gucci Mane backed up on himself denying the rumor. Gucci also stated that his baby mama isn’t eligible for the responsibility. Rapper Gucci even claimed that he is taking care of his child by paying for Keitheon’s medical expenses and health insurances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gucci-and-Sheena.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Keitheon_%E2%80%93_Name_Meaning></span>Keitheon – Name Meaning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The name Keitheon is a form of Keith.
