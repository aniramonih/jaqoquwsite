Her 15 year-old daughter is pregnant on the show, and Ringwald discussed the recent teen pregnancy boom, particularly the case in Glouchester, MA where 17 girls in one school were pregnant that was initially blamed on a pregnancy pact. Ringwald herself played a pregnant high school senior in the 1998 1988 movie <i>For Keeps</i>.</p><p>I think [teenage pregnancy] always will [happen]. The best thing that you can do is just communicate with your kids. I hope this show kind of does that. It’s not only about teenage pregnancy, it’s an issue that’s going on, and I think it’s the kind of show that kids and parents can watch together.</p><p>[Transcribed from Molly Ringwald’s appearance on Good Morning America, video above]</p><p>Ringwald has a four year-old daughter at home. She told Robin Roberts that things haven’t changed <i>that</i> much since she starred in teen movies in the 80s and that the issues of teen pregnancy and drug use are still very relevant today.</p><p>They showed footage of Molly Ringwald on Good Morning America from 23 years ago when she was promoting The Breakfast Club. She covered her face and got red and when Robin asked her what she would tell her young self she said “I don’t know, I think she’s ok.”</p><p>Molly said her family just moved to LA and that she started playing the ukulele as a hobby after seeing a girl named <a href=#>Julia Nunes play on Youtube</a>. She also admitted to being an eBay addict.</p><p>Molly was also on Regis and Kelly and she said the show is a way to let everyone know she’s no longer a teenager. Kelly said she still watches 16 Candles and The Breakfast club.</p><p>It’s great to see Molly out in the spotlight again and you wonder what she was doing all this time. According to <a href=#>Wikipedia</a>, she turned down Julia Roberts’ role in <i>Pretty Woman</i> and Demi Moore’s role in <i>Ghost</i>, a decision she’s said she regrets. Her career floundered in the 1990s. She lived in France for four around that time, and did a few b-movies, and some television and stage performances. She appeared nude in the film Malicious in 1995, and on the ABC series “Townies” in 1996, which was canceled after one season. She has had several stage appearances in recent years in Cabaret, Enchanted April and Sweet Charity. She has been married to writer Panio Gianopoulos since 2007, and they have four year old daughter Mathilda together.</p><p>Molly Ringwald on Regis & Kelly, Part 1<br></p><p>Molly Ringwalk on Regis & Kelly, Part 2<br></p><p>Molly Ringwald is shown at the AFI Lifetime achievement award honouring Warren Beatty on 6/12/08.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i153.photobucket.com/albums/s218/celebitchy/08junea/mollyringwaldfooter.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmampma4Rwuc6lo7KXop67qMPApZuYrJGhuLSr056cp5egp7KousCnmrKXo5bGtKvToaCnn6OUtaLCxKermJuYlruoscOYqqKmk5qstLTEmK6aq4%2BWrLWxxKdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
