Her family confirmed the news on Wednesday, July 26. “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Sinéad,” they said in a statement to RTE. “Her family and friends are devastated and have requested privacy at this very difficult time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bob-Geldof-Says-Friend-Sinead-OConnors-Final-Text-Messages-Were-Laden-With-Desperation3.jpg><p>A cause of death was not immediately confirmed, but British authorities said that <a href=#>they do not suspect foul play</a>. London’s Metropolitan Police said officers responded to “reports of an unresponsive woman at a residential address” in the city, adding that O’Connor was “pronounced dead at the scene.”</p><p>The police <a href=#>notified O’Connor’s family</a> after she was found. “The death is not being treated as suspicious,” the statement continued. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of O’Connor’s death.</p><p>Before his public tribute to O’Connor, Geldof said that he’d known her since she was very young. According to Geldof, O’Connor was a big fan of his band, the Boomtown Rats.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bob-Geldof-Says-Friend-Sinead-OConnors-Final-Text-Messages-Were-Laden-With-Desperation2.jpg><p>“Sinéad lived down the road from me and Garry [Roberts], the guitar player in the band who died about six or seven months ago. We are quite literally down the road,” Geldof told Irish Web TV. “So, we’ve known that girl most of her life, really. She was a big Rats fan.”</p><p>Geldof explained that the band wanted to <a href=#>dedicate their Cavan Calling performance</a> to O’Connor because it felt like “the only thing” they could do to <a href=#>honor her memory</a>. “We were friends all the way through,” he continued. “She was signed to the same little record label we were signed to, by the same guy, had the same manager and stuff like that, so there’s a big connection there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabp5JitKa4w6idZpyVqa6quNJmqqKmlZaxbrvCqKWnp6Koeq2t0q1krZ2oqXqusdKsmKCdo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
