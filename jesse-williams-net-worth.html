He and his estranged wife, Aryn Drake-Lee, got divorced after being married for five years. The former couple met in 2007 and dated for a while before walking down the aisle on September 1, 2012. In their marriage, they welcomed two children, a daughter <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Sadie Williams</a></strong> (born December 6, 2013), and a son, <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Maceo Williams</a></strong> (born in October 2015).</p><p>However, in April 2017, Williams filed for a divorce from his wife, five years after their marriage. In October 2020, three years later, the divorce was finally finalized. According to their divorce settlement, the ex-pair share a joint legal and physical custody of their kids. Similarly, they must discuss uploading any pictures of their children on social media profiles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jesse-Williams-with-his-former-wife.jpg><p>Moreover, Jesse will have to pay $40,000 every month as child support. He was also ordered to pay over $100,000 in two upcoming spousal support payments. Talking about the assets, Jesse’s estranged wife, Aryn, kept their home in LA, while the former pair will take their respective vehicles.</p><p>In addition, Williams did not have to split the profits worth $936,810 that he made in the show Grey’s Anatomy since their separation. It seems like the divorce proceedings made a dent in Jesse’s fortune. The significant amount of child and spousal support might affect his wealth. But there is no doubt that a talented artist will earn millions in the future to cover for it.</p><p>In March 2022, Jesse asked the court to reduce the child support amount he has to pay since he is no longer working on Grey’s Anatomy. He has stated the show was his primary income source and after leaving his income is fluctuating.</p><p>Well, we have to wait and watch what the judge decides.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lifestyle_And_Assets></span>Lifestyle And Assets<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As stated above, Jesse Williams’s net worth is estimated to be $12 million. All thanks to his multi-million dollars of fortune, he is able to live a comfortable life with his family in LA. And with such massive wealth, Jesse might also pay a considerable amount in taxes.</p><p>Furthermore, he also has a great interest in cars and owns an Audi convertible. Therefore, he must have an insurance policy for his vehicle. In addition, going through his Instagram, we can see that, he has collections of gold chains and loves wearing them.</p><p>Looking at his total earnings there is doubt that Williams is doing really great for himself.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trivia></span>Trivia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Jesse was born on August 5, 1981, to his mother, <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Johanna Chase</a>,</strong> and his father, <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Reginald Williams</a>.</strong></li><li>Jesse grew up in Chicago, Illinois, with his <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>younger brothers</a>, <strong>Coire Williams</strong> and <strong>Matt Williams</strong>.</li><li>His mom and dad worked as a ceramist and a factory worker, respectively, before becoming teachers.</li><li>Jesse is currently dating <strong>Taylour Paige</strong>.</li></ul><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<i></i>and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & TV Series,</a></strong>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;<i><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebrityMirror</a>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeinrCpsdKtZJydnJqvs7XTopysZ5qawLSxjLCgpaSZlrq0ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
