To keep fit, Waititi splits his time between the gym and healthy eating.</p><p><strong>He is also known to smoke on occasion. All in all, this mysterious Taika Waititi tattoo has sparked much speculation – only a few people know the real story behind it.</strong></p><p>Of course, Waititi is not the only celebrity with interesting tattoos. Singer Rihanna has a shark tattoo on her ankle which she got to honor her grandmother.</p><p>Supermodel Gigi Hadid has an array of tattoos, including a lion on her thumb and an eye on her forearm. Meanwhile, Justin Bieber’s many tattoos include a crown on his collarbone, a knight on his arm, and a cross on his chest.</p><p>Waititi also has some other tattoos that aren’t as widely discussed. It is reported that he has an <strong>infinity sign on his arm</strong> which is hidden by a t-shirt, as well as a sun tattoo on the back of his neck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/infinity-sign-on-his-arm.jpg><p>He also has an unknown tattoo behind his ear.</p><p><strong>When asked about the meaning behind his tattoos, Taika Waititi stated: “The meaning of my tattoos? It’s pretty simple, really – they’re personal to me, so I don’t want to explain them.”</strong></p><p>This mysterious viewpoint has only added fuel to the discussion surrounding his latest knuckle tattoo.</p><p>What we do know is that Waititi is a big fan of the art form, often talking about the importance of tattoos in a positive way.</p><p>In an interview with GQ Magazine, he said: “I think tattoos are great. They provide a way for people to express themselves and their stories in a creative and permanent way. I’m sure everyone’s got a tattoo story.”</p><p>Clearly, the story behind his latest tattoo is only known to Taika Waititi himself. With such a personal choice, it’s understandable why he’s remaining tight-lipped about the significance of the ink.</p><p>It’s unclear when exactly Waititi got the tattoo, or what inspired him to get it done. It could be related to his relationship with Ora, or the upcoming Thor movie, or perhaps both. Whatever the meaning, his new tattoo is sure to be a conversation starter for a long time to come.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Mystery-Behind-Taika-Waititis-Tattoo.png><p>Regardless of its ultimate meaning, the fact remains that body art is becoming an increasingly popular form of self-expression amongst celebs these days.</p><p>As more and more stars share their individual stories through tattoos, it’s likely that Waititi’s latest ink will only add to the discussion.</p><p>For now, all we can do is speculate, and leave the real meaning behind this mysterious tattoo up to Taika Waititi.</p><p>Who knows, maybe one day we’ll find out why he chose to get this particular piece of art. Until then, we have to just appreciate the initial beauty of the ink and wonder what it could stand for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln5myrbLAnKtnm5%2BifLa60ZqtnqScnruoedOhnGalqajBpr7YZpmeoJmjsW7AwKKimmWnlra1tdOiqmaskanBsLuO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
