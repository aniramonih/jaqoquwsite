In the world of “Outlander,” her character Brianna has been revealed to be pregnant again.</p><p>In an interview with CinemaBlend, Skelton shared her character’s feelings about the second pregnancy. “Season 7 picks up with Brianna feeling a little more content about this pregnancy,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sophie-Skelton-1.jpg><p>Skelton added that the circumstances are far better than her first pregnancy in the show, which was marred by a brutal assault and numerous emotional and physical challenges.</p><p>In contrast to her previous experiences, Brianna’s second pregnancy, according to Skelton, is filled with happiness and contentment. She explained, “She just feels so blessed and content and happy.</p><p>Her side gets her Roger; she has her family there, so really, I think her heart’s just very full, and she’s feeling much more relaxed about this pregnancy and the safety of it.”</p><p>It’s important to note that while her character Brianna is pregnant in the series, the actress, Sophie, is not. This confusion is often a result of fans associating actors with their on-screen characters, which leads to speculation about their personal lives.</p><h2>Sophie Skelton Kids And Partner</h2><p>Away from the “Outlander” set, Sophie Skelton prefers to keep her personal life private. The 29-year-old British actress has not made any public announcements about having children as of 2023.</p><p>Like her pregnancy rumors, this speculation often arises from her role as Brianna, a mother in the show. As for her romantic life, Skelton has been known to be entirely private.</p><p>While she’s shared some heartfelt moments with co-star Richard Rankin during press events and interviews, she’s been careful not to disclose any details about her relationships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sophie-Skelton-2.jpg><p>She and Rankin play married couple Brianna and Roger on “Outlander,” whose bond continues to deepen in the show’s seventh season. Their on-screen chemistry and shared scenes have led some fans to speculate about a potential off-screen romance.</p><p>However, no concrete evidence or official statement has confirmed these rumors. In the same CinemaBlend interview, Richard Rankin shared his thoughts on the upcoming season.</p><p>He highlighted the strength of their on-screen relationship, hinting at further trials and tribulations for Roger and Brianna in Season 7.</p><p>“They’re settling as a family, but if you know Outlander, nothing lasts.</p><p>Something will come along to test them, but they are much more solid as a couple and supportive of each other,” he said.</p><p>In conclusion, while Sophie Skelton’s character Brianna navigates the complexities of a second pregnancy and motherhood in the seventh season of “Outlander” in real life, Skelton is not pregnant.</p><p>Likewise, there are no reports of her having children or public details about her romantic life in 2023. As fans, it’s essential to respect the actress’s privacy and differentiate her personal life from her character’s.</p><p><strong>Also read</strong>: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Meet Isabelle Bernardo’s Husband Joaquim Manzini, Relationship Timeline</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57yKxkrKegnbamedKknKWsn6N6sb7EoKWapqRitq95kWlpbGWbnrG0ec%2Baqa2mlad8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
