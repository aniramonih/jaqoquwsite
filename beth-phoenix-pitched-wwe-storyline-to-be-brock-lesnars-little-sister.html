She was offered a developmental contract a year later and made her RAW debut in 2006.</p><p>Fun Fact: At one of my first gigs as a @WWE extra I pitched a detailed storyline to Michael Hayes to be brought in as Brock Lesnar’s sister. I had ZERO CHILL.</p><p>However, a legitimate jaw injury put her on the sidelines for several months. She returned to the red brand in 2007 and won the now-defunct WWE Women’s Championship in October of the same year.</p><p>Ironically, she left the company the same year Brock Lesnar made his highly-anticipated return. Following her induction into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2017, Phoenix joined NXT as a part-time color commentator. She also makes sporadic wrestling appearances for WWE in addition to working as a full-time color commentator on NXT 2.0.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
