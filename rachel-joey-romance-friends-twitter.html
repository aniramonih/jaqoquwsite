In over one hundred tweets, the fan detailed their point of view, writing: "Ross never saw Rachel as a Friend, but Joey did. From the moment the friends first meet Rachel, Ross immediately sees her as a romantic prospect. He's never gotten over his crush on her. Joey, of course, greets her with 'how YOU doin' and Monica appropriately smacks him down for hitting on a woman on her wedding day but this is presented as Joey's standard greeting to every hot woman ever, not specific to Rachel."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e843aa6c7851-friends-ross-z.jpg><p id=eCQwSK7Ecfcb style=text-align:center data-wc=8><strong>In the show, Rachel ends up with Ross</strong></p><p id=e2Z5r2fA4IAB data-wc=135>They continued: "But Joey's relationship with Rachel is platonic almost right away. They have a genuine friendship. He frequently gives her dating advice… He sets her up on dates with men he thinks she'll like. He lets her crash the set when he's filming and flirt with soap actors... HE MAKES HER LAUGH… Joey's feelings for Rachel were born out of genuine friendship. They were roommates. SHE WAS PREGNANT. We honestly don't talk enough about how big a deal it is that Joey, the 'shallow' one, falls in love with Rachel while she's pregnant. It happens the way realistically healthy relationships do: they just start spending a lot more time together. He has to LEARN to see Rachel as a romantic prospect because she's always been a friend first. Which was NEVER true for Ross."</p><p id=eOugwGz7kBiy data-wc=13><a class=hm-link href=#>READ: David Schwimmer confirms he and wife Zoe Buckman are on a break</a></p><p id=eGHNAGm2QgJ4 data-wc=71>Kaneandgriffen concluded the argument, writing: "The only factor in favour of Ross/Rachel endgame is conventional sitcom storytelling structure. Not because they're RIGHT for each other. Ross and Rachel were endgame because they were considered INEVITABLE, and I don't dispute that that's where the show was always heading. But a S10 surprise twist where Rachel and Joey end up realising THEY were each other's lobster all along WOULD HAVE CHANGED SITCOM TV."</p><p id=eri8MQMDwIXp data-wc=17><a class=hm-link href=#>READ:&nbsp;Friends child star Cole Sprouse looks all grown up as he reveals crush on Jennifer Aniston</a></p><p id=ezFJdLa8UVNX data-wc=67>Users following the popular thread were quick to voice their opinion, with one writing: "I so loved Joey! Loved Joey with Rachel! Wish that he and she had the baby together instead of Rachel and Ross to be truthful," while another person added: "Shows proper insight, he really loves her and wants the best for her (as a friend) - Joey is the best character by far."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
