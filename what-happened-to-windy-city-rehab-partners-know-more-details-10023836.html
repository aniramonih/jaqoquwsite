Alison Victoria is an interior designer and real estate agent based in Chicago, who has been featured on several other HGTV shows, including Kitchen Crashers and Rock the Block. She serves as the host and lead designer for Windy City Rehab, overseeing the design and renovation of the properties.</p><p>Donovan Eckhardt is a real estate developer with experience in construction, project management, and property flipping. He served as the contractor and project manager for the renovation projects on Windy City Rehab, overseeing the construction and renovation work on the properties. However, as mentioned earlier, their partnership became strained and ended after the first season of the show due to legal issues related to the properties featured on the show. Since then, Alison Victoria has continued to work on the show with a different team.</p><h2>What Happened to Windy City Rehab Partners?</h2><p>There have been several reports and legal issues related to the partnership between Alison Victoria, the host of Windy City Rehab, and her former business partner, Donovan Eckhardt. The two worked together on the show's first season, renovating properties in Chicago and splitting profits from the sales. However, their partnership reportedly became strained over disagreements about design choices, budgets, and project management.</p><p>In May 2019, the City of Chicago suspended the permit for Windy City Rehab after several violations were found on properties featured on the show, including issues with permits and code violations. Donovan Eckhardt was named in many of the city's complaints about the properties, and he was subsequently sued by multiple homeowners who had purchased properties renovated by Windy City Rehab, claiming shoddy workmanship and code violations.</p><p>In August 2019, Alison Victoria announced that she had cut ties with Donovan Eckhardt and their joint company, Greymark Development Group, stating that she was "disappointed" in the legal issues and that her "values and principles as a businesswoman" were not aligned with Eckhardt's. Since then, Victoria has continued to work on the show, now partnering with a different team to renovate properties in Chicago.

Eckhardt claimed that Victoria and Weinstein had made false and defamatory statements about him in the media, which had caused him financial harm and damage to his reputation. It is unclear exactly what statements Eckhardt was referring to. However, a California court recently dismissed Eckhardt's defamation claims against Victoria and Weinstein. The court ruled that his claims lacked sufficient evidence to proceed, indicating that he did not provide enough evidence to support his allegations of defamation. The court also reportedly ordered Eckhardt to pay Victoria's attorney fees and costs related to the case.</p><p>It's important to note that this lawsuit pertains specifically to Eckhardt's claims of defamation against Victoria and her attorney, and is separate from the legal issues and controversies related to Windy City Rehab that have been previously reported.</p><h2>Did Windy City Rehab Partners Break Up?</h2><p>Yes, Alison Victoria and Donovan Eckhardt, the original partners of Windy City Rehab, did break up their partnership following the first season of the show.

She has also launched her own company, Alison Victoria Interiors, and has been involved in several other design and real estate projects outside of Windy City Rehab. Meanwhile, Donovan Eckhardt reportedly left the real estate development business altogether and is now working as a sales representative for a building materials company.</p><h2>What is the Show Windy City Rehab all About?</h2><p>Windy City Rehab is a reality television show that premiered on HGTV in January 2019. The show is set in Chicago and features the renovation of old homes and properties in the city. The show is hosted by Alison Victoria, a Chicago-based interior designer, and real estate agent.
