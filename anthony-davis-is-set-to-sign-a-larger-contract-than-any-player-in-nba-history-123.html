However, if he makes one of the three All-NBA teams next year, he could sign the supermax next offseason, when he's a free agent. Similarly, <a href=# rel=noopener>Draymond Green</a> didn't make the All-NBA team this year but could do so next season. However, since <a href=# rel=noopener>Steph Curry</a> has already agreed to a supermax deal, only one, either Green or Thompson could potentially sign a supermax contract.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meanwhile, <a href=# rel=noopener>Paul George</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Jimmy Butler</a> could have signed supermax deals or extensions if they had stayed with the Pacers and Bulls respectively. Instead, they gave up that ability when they were traded.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So don't feel too bad for Davis. Even though his Pelicans fell to the Warriors in the second round, he's about to become a very wealthy man.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpqlraCfo8ZusMCvoKxlmah6tLHTZquoZaOetK95wGajmqqXmr9ur86nq6uZk6l6tbTAp2Sapqliva2t2J6pZqGeYrujrYyhoKysn6fGbn2RbGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
