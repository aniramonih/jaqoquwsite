For the Carolina Herrera fall/winter preview, the Tennessee native looked pretty in a pink strapless dress that featured a heart design at the bodice. Ballerini paired the frock with a fuchsia overcoat and coordinating sandal heels. She wore her hair in a sleek updo that featured loose, face-framing strands.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>A few days earlier, the “Peter Pan” artist sat front row at the PatBO show and looked radiant in red. She stunned in a sequin suit that featured an oversized blazer and wide-leg pants. Ballerini teamed the getup with a bold red lip and wore her hair in a middle part down her back.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She also attended the Prabal Gurung presentation and was almost too hot to handle. The CMA Award-winner showed skin in a figure-hugging black cutout gown that featured a completely sheer skirt. She added a bit of bling with dangling crystal earrings. For glam, she donned a dramatic smoky eye and a glossy lip.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ballerini went on to tap Prabal Gurung for the <a href=#>65th annual Grammy Awards</a> in Los Angeles in February 2023. The “Miss Me More” singer looked like a ray of sunshine in a yellow gown by the fashion house. The garment was made with a daring high slit a criss cross halter top and a cascading train. She gave the ensemble a monochrome finish by sporting lemon-colored heels.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The “Yeah Boy” songstress also turned heads at the 56th annual <a href=#>CMA Awards in November 2022</a>. That night she graced the red carpet in Balenciaga’s aqua gloved gown, which was also on <strong>MacKenzie Porter</strong> at the same event and <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> at the Vanity Fair Oscars Party in March 2022.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ballerini reacted to the <a href=#>twinning moment</a> the next day in a video posted <a href=#>via TikTok</a>, sharing: “It’s giving: Blue is the moment. It’s giving: Great minds think alike. It’s giving: I immediately changed into a green dress because she looked so good in it.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She added: “It’s giving: Don’t you dare do a ‘Who wore it better?’ or put a side-by-side. It’s rude.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>A month prior, Ballerini donned another Balenciaga ensemble at the 2022 CMT Artists of the Year event. The yellow silk number was equipped with a wrap skirt and a button-up construction. (Former First Lady <a href=#><strong>Michelle Obama</strong></a> famously sported the piece during the Brooklyn stop of her Becoming book tour in December 2018.)</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to see Ballerini’s glamorous style evolution:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvKnqOsnZFir6K4y56poqaZqHqouMitsbJlo6nGrbGMnq2opKWptrC6jK2fq6elnLVuwMeeZLKdkafAbrzHqKuoq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
