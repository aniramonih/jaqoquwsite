U.S. intelligence agencies refer to them now as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) but to the rest of us, they will continue to go by the friendly moniker unidentified flying objects (UFO)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Whichever acronym you prefer, a leaked photo of a UAP/UFO has been passed along through the various U.S. intelligence agencies has now made its way to the public.</p><p>Here’s the photo…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ufo1-900x675.jpg><p>And here’s a zoom-in on the UFO…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dropsonde_1.png><p>The UFO photo in question, which was first shared in a report by <a href=#>The Debrief</a>, shows what officials have described as a silver, “cube-shaped” object. The photo itself dates back a couple of years to 2018 when it became part of a report from the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF), which is the official unit of the Department of Defense (DoD) that investigates UAP sightings. On August 4, 2020, Deputy Secretary of Defense David L. Norquist <a href=#>approved the creation</a> of the UAPTF, under the leadership of the United States Navy. The UAPTF was created by the DoD to get a better understanding of UAP/UFO’s to include their nature and origin with a mission to detect, analyze, and register any UAP’s that may pose a threat to our U.S. national security.</p><p>According to The Debrief, the UFO photo is considered “Unclassified and For Official Use Only” and when they reached out to the Pentagon, they received this response from Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Gough, “To maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, DOD does not discuss publicly the details of reports, observations or examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace, including those incursions initially designated as UAP.”</p><p>The silver, cube-like object was encountered by military pilots flying in what appears to be a F/A-18 fighter jet. The UFO image looks to be taken by the backseat weapons systems operator and was captured by his personal cell phone. The pilots were flying off the east coast when they encountered the UAP.</p><p>The UFO is difficult to make out, even when enhancing it. Though the official report describes it as a cube, in the image it appears to be an inverted bell-shaped object. When the pilots observed it, the object was simply hovering over the ocean. A closer look at the object shows what appears to be ridges along its lateral edges that extend toward the base.</p><p>As the UFO photo became public, there were a few suggestions as to what the object could be. Some say the object resembles a <a href=#>GPS dropsonde</a>, which is a small weather reconnaissance instrument, but as the comparison was made, it was also pointed out that one of the main features of a dropsonde, the GPS receiver, was missing. Terry Hock, the In-situ Sensing Facility (ISF) Manager at the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Earth Observing Laboratory, said, “In regards to the photo, while the image of the object is not clear, it certainly does not look like a dropsonde,” Hock told The Debrief, “because there are no signs of a dropsonde below the object where the object could potentially be a parachute, and it does not have the right shape.” From Hock’s vantage point, he says it more closely resembles a mylar balloon. “There are scientific research groups that do launch balloons which they refer to as drifters,” Hock told us. “[T]his may be a possibility.”</p><p>Here’s what a GPS dropsonde looks like for comparison…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Other possibilities include a military-radar reflector or even a research balloon. But, according to The Debrief, two officials in the know said that when the pilots encountered the UFO, it didn’t react the way a normal balloon would. This object remained completely motionless, unaffected by the air currents surrounding it.</p><p>This UFO photo comes on the heels of <a href=#>three officially released videos</a> in April of this year by the U.S. Navy. The videos were leaked at first, prompting the Navy to finally make them official. <a href=#>The videos</a> show what appear to be UAPs, one from a video taken in 2004 and the other two were taken from an encounter in January 2015.</p><p>Of course, this all follows the recent claim by the 87-year-old retired Israeli general <a href=#>Professor Haim Eshed</a> that not only has humanity made contact with aliens, but we have made contact with a “Galactic Federation.” <a href=#>His claims</a> include that the majority of the world has been kept in the dark about it because the world was not ready for the news. They also include, according to Eshed, that President Trump has been wanting to divulge the existence of the aliens but continues to get pressure from the “Galactic Federation” to remain silent. Supposedly, the aliens and US scientists were working in tandem in an underground base on Mars with hopes to unravel the mysteries of the universe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue9KcoGitlqR6sbTOraZmm6WXsm%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
