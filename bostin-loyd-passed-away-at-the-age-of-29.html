Generation Iron broke the news of his death, reporting that Loyd had collapsed at his home in Springhill, Florida. He was afterward transferred to a neighboring hospital and declared dead. According to Fitness Volts, Loyd passed out after heading to the gym. He was rushed to the hospital, where C.P.R. was used to try to resuscitate him. The cause of death has not yet been determined. Loyd’s fiancée Ariella Palumbo and their son Jaxtin survive him. The couple allegedly tried for a second child in December of last year.</p><h2>The expected cause of death for Bostin Loyd</h2><p>Bostin Loyd is said to have died of a heart attack. With his past health difficulties, additional underlying conditions probably contributed to his myocardial infarction. Throughout his career, the 29-year-old bodybuilder had controversial views on steroids and was open to his usage of biologically active drugs. Loyd was one of the first competitive bodybuilders to reveal their drug cycle combined with workouts to get such a physique.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bostin-Loyd-2.jpg alt="Bostin Loyd" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bostin Loyd had kidney failure after using a steroid known as a peptide. The bodybuilder was diagnosed with stage five renal failure in October 2020. He earlier said that he had been treated with recovery peptides, Gluthithione, and stem cell treatment but that his advanced condition had not improved much. He was also being considered for dialysis.</p><p></p><p>Loyd went to Facebook two days before his death, writing:</p><p>“I’m taking it day by day.” My statistics continue to deteriorate. I have good days and terrible days (mostly good). Despite the fact that my bloodwork results continue to worsen, I feel better today than I did when I was originally diagnosed.”</p><p>Loyd launched a complete steroid cycle after winning the N.P.C. Contra Costa at 21. He claimed to be the first pro-bodybuilder to provide such information.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bostin-Loyd-3.jpg alt="Bostin Loyd" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Following his untimely demise, many people have expressed condolences to Bostin Loyd’s family.</h2><p>Following his death, countless tweets paid respect to the late bodybuilder. While some mentioned his controversy, the majority of tweets praised his charisma. His son Jaxtin directed a message intended for him on his partner’s Instagram profile. He penned:</p><p>“I shall miss you every day, Dad.” I adore you. R.D.P.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I was floored this morning when I heard that my friend Bostin Loyd had passed away.</p><p>While Bostin had his online persona, personally he was always a kind and caring man and loved his family. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Xu5AESlBzD</a></p><p>— Marc Lobliner – IFBB Pro (@MarcLobliner) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 25, 2022</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Loyd said that although he hoped for a miracle in his recovery, he was prepared for any scenario.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Bostin Loyd age</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Bostin Loyd Death</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZqKuknrtuuM6ym2aokajAprCMmq6asV2WwW7Ax55kmp%2BVYryneZFyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
