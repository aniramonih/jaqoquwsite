Where we’re trending offensively … there’s a lot of really good things, but what ultimately matters is you have to score more points.”</p><p>Robinson is averaging 2.9 yards per carry and 39.8 rushing yards per game in his last five games (69 rushes for 199 yards). He has 63 total receiving yards in that span. Robinson is healthy, Smith said.</p><p>“He played a lot of snaps (against Minnesota), and sometimes, his impact away from the ball can open things up,” Smith said. “For any rookie, the seasons are long. You’re going to have ebbs and flows. We’ll see how this second half of the season goes, but he’s been a huge part of our offense and he’ll continue to be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57y6KtnmWSobyov46nnaVlp5qyrHmQaWSsm5%2BnsrR5z6KapKtdpb%2BmsMicq6Knnqh6tK%2FHnpuupJViwLWtzZ2gp5%2BjZJpxk5CSeI6Dg4iyo3unf4yEjXyBmpifoqdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
