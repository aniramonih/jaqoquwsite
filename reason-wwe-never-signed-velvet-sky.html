According to the former TNA Knockout, she believe it would have never worked because WWE wanted to create their own version of The Beautiful people.</p><p>“This is like the million dollar question: How come The Beautiful People were never in the WWE. Well, it’s because [WWE] wanted to create their own version of what is already out there that they see that works. And, The Beautiful People, Angelina and I, we would never want The Beautiful People to be tainted or twisted or anything that I feel WWE would try to do to us if we were ever there. We would never be allowed to be The Beautiful People. The entrance? Forget it. We’d never be able to let the pigeons loose there. It wouldn’t work there, and like I said, they’ve created their own version of The Beautiful People, so they even knew that we worked.”</p><p>Sky also basically said WWE ripped off the Beautiful People gimmick with Laycool gimmick and are now doing it once again with The IIconics.</p><p>“Back when we were still in TNA, it was LayCool, and now it’s the IIconics. It’s the same kind of mean, ‘I’m better than you’, the whispering, the pointing, the laughing, the humiliating. I mean, especially in the middle of our Beautiful People peak is when they created LayCool. They were kinda doing the similar antics, the humiliating the girls, the heel role. I mean, it’s very flattering, I must say it’s flattering that what we have is such high demand that they tried to take the ball and gave it to the girls that are there now.”</p><p>Sky also mentioned that she has no interests in going to WWE because she wouldn’t have the creative freedom that she would in other promotions.</p><p><strong>Do you think Laycool & IIconics are a rip off of The Beautiful People?
