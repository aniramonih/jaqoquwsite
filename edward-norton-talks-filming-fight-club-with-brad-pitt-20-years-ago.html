For starters, the actor can hardly believe it’s been that long.</p><p>“I don’t feel 20 years older!” Norton, 50, said at the premiere of his new film, <a href=#>Motherless Brooklyn</a>, at Hollywood Post 43 on Monday, October 28. “I can’t say I felt like we did it yesterday, but I think that 20 years is hard to accept because I felt like I was a mature person when we did it. Apparently, I was really, like, a child.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Edward-Norton-Brad-Pitt-Fight-Club.jpg><p>The three-time Academy Award nominee plays Fight Club’s unnamed narrator, an automobile recall specialist whose uninspiring life gets turned upside-down by soap salesman Tyler Durden — played by <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a> — who welcomes him into an underground fight club.</p><p>Norton told Us he has “many” fond memories of working with Pitt, 55. “One thing I’ve noticed is that [in] all the pictures of us making that movie, we were laughing all the time,” he explained. “The whole experience was an experience of laughter and creativity. Brad is funny. [Costar] <a href=#><strong>Helena [Bonham Carter]</strong></a> is really funny. [Director <strong>David</strong>] <strong>Fincher</strong>’s really funny. [Script doctor] <strong>Andy Walker</strong>’s funny. It was a funny bunch of people doing a dark comedy, so it was a lot of laughs.”</p><p>The actor would be eager to work with Pitt again — or even to direct the <a href=#>Ad Astra</a> star, now that Norton has helmed both Motherless Brooklyn and the 2000 film Keeping the Faith. “I’d rather act in one of his [directorial efforts],” he added. “But I would do it. If he would be in one of mine, I’d do it. … I think we’d rather be in something together probably.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Edward-Norton-Motherless-Brooklyn.jpg><p>In an exclusive interview with Us earlier this week, Norton’s Motherless Brooklyn costar <a href=#><strong>Gugu Mbatha-Raw</strong></a> praised him as a director. “[Norton] had so much going on in this film, wearing so many hats literally and metaphorically, in costume and also as a director, and a writer and your scene partner,” the 36-year-old said. “For me, it was such a bonus because you spend just a couple of minutes with Edward and you understand how deeply intelligent and passionate he is, and really, very articulate.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Motherless Brooklyn hits theaters on Friday, November 1.</p><p>With reporting by Nicole Pajer</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJydr5GnsW66zqurqKZdqa6tt9JmnaKknZ67qHnFop6hrF2YubaujLCgraBdl7%2BisIypoK2sXWd9bsXEmqmsZZGcvHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
