However, it's not yet confirmed when the live shows will be on our screens to see who will be crown champion and perform at the Royal Variety Show. Shortly before the audition episodes returned, ITV said they hope the shows would return "later in the year".</p><p id=eLM_k_mNvPyQ data-wc=143>As well as this, long-term judge Amanda Holden explained the situation on her Heart FM radio show after being asked if the show would run without a studio audience. "I mean I think that Ant and Dec did an amazing job of Takeaway but I'm not sure our show, I think our show would suffer quite badly from not having a proper audience," she explained. "We have heard it's the autumn [that they will air]," she added. "I would say it might be later than September but it's quite a competitive time of year as well so… I'm hoping we can still strip it, strip means we sort of do it every single day like we used to or we might end up doing it over the weekends but it's all still in the running but I definitely think it's for the best."</p><p id=ep_2-XLexv7- data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Why Simon Cowell may not have any more children according to his best friend</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6e05b057ea63-britains-got-talent-judges-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eIUhV0nGPm5n data-wc=12><strong>ITV are hoping for the live shows to return later this year</strong></p><h2>Who has reached the live finals of Britain's Got Talent?</h2><p id=eUR9qbAls1Fh data-wc=79>One of the best things about the nation's favourite talent show is the Golden Buzzer that transports acts straight to the live final. All for judges, and Ant and Dec, have given away their Golden Buzzer, meaning the live final is already looking to be a spectacular show for when it returns. The acts received the buzzer are: choir Sign Along With Us, singer Fayth Ifil, comedian and singer Jon Courtenay, singers Honey and Sammy, and comedian Nabil Abdulrashid.</p><p id=ewuwL9-W7LkV data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
