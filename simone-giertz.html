The truck was built in response to both wanting an electric vehicle to avoid ever owning a gasoline-powered car and a pickup truck for practical reasons, but not being able to wait for the at-the-time only proposed Tesla pickup. The accompanying parody commercial and 31-minute video describing the build process went viral and received significant news coverage. She was subsequently invited to the unveiling of the Tesla's official pickup truck, the Cybertruck.</p><p>In August 2019, Giertz traveled to New Zealand to work on a mantis shrimp costume with Weta Workshop.</p><p>On April 30, 2018, Giertz announced via YouTube that she had been diagnosed with a noncancerous brain tumor. After surgery to remove the grade I meningioma on May 30, 2018, she has continued to post humorous and upbeat accounts of her post-surgery progress, including photos of her "potential super-villain scar" and a public address video on her Patreon account. On January 18, 2019, Giertz reported that her tumor had returned. After a course of radiation treatments, Giertz again returned to production on May 29, 2019, describing her ordeal and with a project converting her head alignment mask into a work of art.</p><p>In 2016, Giertz joined Tested.com, collaborating with <a href=#>Adam Savage</a> on her first project, the Popcorn Feeding Helmet. In 2017, she hosted the comedy TV show Manick with Nisse Hallberg on Swedish TV6. The basic premise of the show is that the hosts invent funny creative solutions to everyday problems. In April 2018, she created a robot to promote season 2 of HBO's Westworld. Around this time Giertz had abandoned the concept of the "shitty robots", later explaining that it was no longer something she wanted to do, as she felt that the joke had played out.</p><p>Giertz named the Disney cartoon character Gyro Gearloose as one of her earliest inspirations. She studied engineering physics in college but dropped out after a year. She started creating "useless" inventions after studying at Hyper Island in Stockholm, where she was inspired by the local open-source hardware community. Giertz's interest in electronics began in 2013; she made a toothbrush helmet for a children's show pilot episode on electronics, which was uploaded to YouTube after not being picked up, starting her YouTube career.</p><p>Simone Luna Louise Söderlund Giertz (Swedish:&nbsp;[ˈjæʈːʂ] ; born 1 November 1990) is a Swedish inventor, maker, robotics enthusiast, TV host, and professional YouTuber. She has also previously worked in mixed martial arts sports journalism, and was an editor for Sweden's official website Sweden.se.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfqLauu82eZKChlafBuw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
