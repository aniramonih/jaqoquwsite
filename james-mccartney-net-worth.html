Therefore, his fortune proliferated rapidly at godspeed, and he made a multi-million fortune.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, James McCartney’s net worth is estimated at $20 million, thanks to his musical earnings and artistic venture. Thus, let’s explore Paul’s kid, James’ earnings, and lifestyle. Also, if you’re wondering whose wealth is greater, Paul or James, let us remind you, the music mogul, Paul McCartney is worth $1.2 billion and counting.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_As_A_Musician></span>Earnings As A Musician<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>James McCartney has established himself as a successful musician without being overwhelmed by his father, Paul McCartney’s career. Hence, he made a fortune of about $20 million since his entry into the musical world in 1997.</p><p>James has contributed a great deal to his father’s solo albums, including Flaming Pie and Driving Rain. He played drums and guitar for Paul McCartney. Likewise, James also helped his father write some lyrics. Interestingly, he left the McCartney family fame and worked on his music while also waiting tables and attending college in 2004.</p><p>Throughout James McCartney’s career, he has released two studio albums, Me (2013) And The Blackberry Train (2016). Likewise, his EPs, Available Light and Close at Hand, came out in 2010 and 2011, respectively.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by James McCartney (@jamesmccartneyofficial)</a></p><p>Also, James released his compilation album, The Complete EP Collection, in 2011. Prior to that, he also helped his mother, Linda McCartney, with her solo album, Wide Prairie, in 1998.</p><p>As of now, James McCartney’s earnings are solely dependent on his musical tour as he’s stopped releasing music. Undoubtedly, his net worth multiplied rapidly, thanks to his musical career. However, his skills are not limited to the melody; the talented McCartney is also a renowned sculptor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jamess_Artistic_Parts_Earns_Him_Fortune></span>James’s Artistic Parts Earns Him Fortune?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Paul McCartney’s IMDb</a>, his son, James McCartney, is also a sculptor. But James’ works as a sculptor are nowhere to be seen. Moreover, he studied art, photography, and English when he was in college.</p><p>Furthermore, words of exhibitions are not uttered, and <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">McCartney’s website</a> talks about his musical career and nothing more.&nbsp;Unlike James, his sisters, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Mary McCartney</strong></a> has established herself as a British photographer, and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Stella McCartney</strong></a> built her name as a fashion designer.</p><p>A sculptor makes on average $48,660 per year, and the paycheck varies from one’s experience and excellence of work. Thus, James McCartney’s income as a sculptor must be handsome if he is into selling his art pieces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/James-McCartney-earns-a-handsome-amount.jpg><p>Hence, art and sculpting also aid James McCartney’s net worth. Besides, the world knows he went into drug abuse after losing his mother, Linda, to cancer. Since James always sought independence, he began earning for his own life at a young age which helped him build his persona as a multi-millionaire in the current days.</p><p>Therefore, hopefully, we will get to see and hear more of James’ music, ultimately adding more zeros to his bank account.</p><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & TV Series</a>,</strong>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;<i><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebrityMirror</a>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeinrCpsdKtZJydnJqvs7XTopysZ5qWuqa%2FjKaanJmiqbumxYynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
