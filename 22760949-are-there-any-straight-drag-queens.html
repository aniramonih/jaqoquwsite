Because trans woman participating in drag or drag race holds zero logic. Drag is cross dressing meaning dressing against your identified gender. What a mess.

He is 'straight' sexually and likes to dress as a woman. I suspect the same is for Dame Edna; attracted to women, but used the 'character' as a way to express his desire to be female. Lots of these types work between the borders of 'drag' and just straight up cross-dressing. Alex Reid and Oscar De la hoya cross dress and may be repressed trans women. Lots of them live 'straight' lives and perfer women way more, but get off on being submissive bottoms for men. odd bunch.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 35</td><td class=timestamp><span>December 23, 2018 2:23 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>R35 It depends what you consider consider means</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 36</td><td class=timestamp><span>December 23, 2018 2:28 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>R36 what an awesome addition to the conversation, you ugly fuck.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 37</td><td class=timestamp><span>December 23, 2018 2:38 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I'm guessing the next season of Drag Race will have at least one trans contestant and one "bio-queen"</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 38</td><td class=timestamp><span>December 24, 2018 6:48 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>There's a trans contestant on All stars right now R38.
