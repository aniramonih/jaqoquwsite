See, Pia Philomena Francesca Henrie has brothers and sisters. Maria and I suffered three miscarriages before finally being able to carry Pia to full term. While it was insanely difficult recovering from miscarriage after miscarriage, we knew if we were ever going to be able to hold a baby of our own in our arms that we must not let the tragedy affect our marriage, but rather grow closer together!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/David-Henrie-Wife-Maria-Cahill-Is-Pregnant-Expecting-2nd-Child.jpg><p>He and the former pageant queen <a href=#>tied the knot in April 2017</a>.
