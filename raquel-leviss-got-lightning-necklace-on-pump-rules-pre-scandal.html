Raquel Leviss splurged on a lightning bolt necklace — like the one Tom Sandoval wears — on Vanderpump Rules before news broke in March that she and the TomTom cofounder were hooking up.
“Ooh, can I see that little lightning bolt?” Raquel, 28, asked in a preview clip from the Wednesday, May 10, episode of Pump Rules while shopping with Charli Burnett. “This is $780?”
The former pageant queen seemingly hinted at her relationship with Tom, 40, in the preview, which was released on Friday, May 5, with the jewelry purchase."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She eventually agreed to pay the expensive price tag, calling the necklace, a “birthday gift to myself.”</p><p>Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed in March</a> that the Tom Sandoval and The Most Extras singer and then-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> split after nine years together. Their public breakup coincided with reports that Tom and Raquel were involved in a months-long affair.</p><p>Shortly after the scandal made headlines, eagle-eyed fans noticed that both <a href=#>the Missouri native and Raquel had been wearing matching lightning bolt necklaces</a> for months.</p><p>“How did no one notice?! My God!” one TikTok user wrote in the comments section of @fernannduh’s video, which claimed to have proof of <a href=#>the pair’s accessories on display</a> while Tom was seeing Ariana, 37.</p><p>A second user quipped: “This literally makes my skin CRAWWWWWL.”</p><p>Raquel was photographed wearing her chain at BravoCon in October 2022. The Schwartz & Sandy’s cofounder, for his part, was seen wearing his necklace to the <a href=#>season 10 Pump Rules premiere</a> in February. He previously wore the piece to the House of Barrie opening in October 2022.</p><p>Throughout season 10 of Pump Rules, <a href=#>Tom denied hooking up with Raquel</a> on several occasions. After news broke of the affair, however, <a href=#>he issued two public apologies for his actions</a>. Raquel also issued a statement of remorse in March.</p><p>Last month, Tom claimed during an appearance on the “Howie Mandel Does Stuff” podcast that <a href=#>he and Raquel were “taking a break”</a> from their romance. He insisted “we’re really good friends” and were currently “not” friends with benefits.</p><p>However, earlier this month, eagle-eyed fans noticed that Tom was once again rocking a lightning bolt item, which seemed to show support for the former Miss Sonoma County.</p><p>The musician was spotted on Thursday, May 4, <a href=#>wearing a lightning bolt jacket</a> while performing with his band, The Most Extras, in Long Island. The style choice raised eyebrows amid the ongoing fallout Tom and Raquel have <a href=#>received from fans and costars alike</a>.</p><p>While Ariana has moved on with <a href=#><strong>Daniel Wai</strong></a>, <a href=#>whom she was seen making out with in April at Coachella</a>, her castmates are still unnerved by what when down.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“These were two of my absolute best friends, so to lose both of them at the same time [was hard],” <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> <a href=#>exclusively told Us</a> on Wednesday, May 3, of learning of Tom and Raquel’s affair. “It was an immediate disconnect, like, we were done that night in New York. I was done with both of them. I could never see continuing a friendship after what I found out.”</p><p>Vanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmaqaWauW64xK%2BgrKtdnLy1ecuinqGsnp67qHnNnpqkpJGYsm67zWanrqWgYr%2B2uMSsZKmqlWLApK3NnZilZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
