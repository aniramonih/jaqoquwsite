How much does Rick make, and about his dedication towards solving The Curse of Oak Island?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rick Lagina Decided His Life To Solve This Mystery Of Oak Island.</h2><p>Rick Lagina read about the mystery of Oak Island when he was very young, and that’s when he decided to solve this mystery. He was a postal worker, but he left his career and dedicated his life to solving a 200-year-old mystery of Oak Island. His brother Marty joined him on a treasure hunt on Oak Island.</p><p>He committed his whole life to find the treasure. He spends his summer up on Oak Island in Nova Scotia with his team. And when he is not on the island, he is trying to find a new way to find the treasure.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Did The Lagina Brothers Go To Oak Island?</h2><p>At the age of 11, Rick used to go to the local library once a week. On one such visit, he picked up and read the January 1965 edition of Reader’s Digest.</p><p>He came across an article about Oak Island, which mentioned the legend of the treasure supposedly buried there, including details about the famed Money Pit. From that moment on, Rick was hooked and became preoccupied with uncovering the mystery.</p><p>Marty was also interested in Oak Island but was more doubtful than his older brother. However, Marty wanted his brother to reach his lifetime goal, so he put up most of the money to purchase the stake in Oak Island Tours Inc.</p><p>His brother Marty has a lot of different businesses, including a winery, but Rick doesn’t. Marty’s net worth is estimated to be nearly $100 million. But Rick earns his money only from the treasure hunt project they have on Oak Island.</p><p>There isn’t any information about Rick’s personal life, and fans can only know the things that are presented in the show. But everyone can say that Rick is a strong and gentleman. He is very hardworking, and because he devoted his life to this mystery, he never married or dated anyone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rick Lagina’s net worth</h2><p>Rick Lagina is a retired postal worker who focuses most of his attention and career on finding the presumed treasure on Oak Island. But, despite his humble background, the reality television star is worth millions. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Rick Lagina’s net worth is evaluated at around $2 million.</p><p>The Curse of Oak Island star gives his summers up in Nova Scotia, hunting for treasure with his team. He supposedly spends most of his time looking for new strategies and information surrounding the Oak Island treasure hunt when he is not on the island.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How does Rick Lagina make his money?</h2><p>Unlike his brother, Marty Lagina, who owns several businesses, including a winery in Traverse City, Michigan, Rick’s revenue comes from a few sources surrounding the Oak Island project.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rick Lagina’s Career</h2><p>Most of the cast from the TV show doesn’t like to talk about their salary, including Rick. Because of that, we don’t know how much Rick makes for an episode of The Curse of Oak Island, but we can say with certainty that most of his income comes from that salary.</p><p>Rick also owns a part of Oak Island. Rick owns Oak Island Tours Incorporated alongside his brother Marty, Craig Tester, Dan Blankenship, and Alan J. Kostrzewa.</p><p>Oak Island Tours Incorporated is a company that makes tours for many people that visits Oak Island. They own most of the island; to be precise, they own 78% of the island. The people come to the island to learn about the history and the treasure. They take them on guided tours all around the island, where they can hear a lot about legends and everything that has to do with the treasure hunt.</p><p>Rick is also a producer of the show. He has a percentage of the show’s earnings, and that indeed isn’t little. And because of his contract with the History Channel, Rick also gets paid every time new or old episodes of The Curse of Oak Island are aired.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does Rick Lagina make per episode?</h2><p>The Lagina brothers and other cast members of The Curse of Oak Island make per episode is unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>But it doesn’t matter how much they get because most of the fans believe that Rick and his brother Marty spend a lot of the money they earn into the fund for their treasure hunt.</p><p>That’s the reason this TV show exists, the love that they feel for this island, and the love they have for the treasure hunt. Both brothers enrolled in this adventure because of the thrill and not because of the money.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Much Have The Lagina Brothers Spent On Oak Island?</h2><p>It’s hard to know for sure since the sum that Rick and Marty paid to gain a 50% share of Oak Island Tours Inc. has always been undisclosed. However, calculations have been made about how much they spend on their drilling and digging operations each year.</p><p>The brothers were granted their treasure-trove license back in July 2010, which enabled them to commence their search at the end of that same year. Being a pure summer endeavour, since the Nova Scotia winters make digging near impossible, the brothers have currently had eight summers searching on Oak Island.</p><p>They’re appreciated for using sophisticated technology and bringing in global experts to aid in their quest, none of which come cheaply. The amount they’ve spent has also clearly increased over the years, with The Curse of Oak Island showing more prominent and better technology coming onto the island every year.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Most Expensive Equipment The Lagina Brothers Have Used On Oak Island</h3><p>The heavy drilling rigs, worth hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars, which are getting even more significant for series six, are by far the most valuable pieces of equipment that the brothers have brought onto the island. The excavators and diggers they’ve used to shift the earth come in a close second.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Biggest Findings On The Curse Of Oak Island</h3><p>Up until the end of series five, the brothers have revealed a number of historically significant items.</p><p>After draining a man-made swamp in series one, they discovered a Spanish 8 Maravedis coin dating to 1652. They also found some non-indigenous coconut fibres in the same series, found after they dove into Smith’s Cove. This discovery hinted at the fact that the original creators of the Money Pit originated from more tropical lands.</p><p>Series five saw arguably the most significant find of the whole show. This medieval lead cross could re-write history if it could help prove evidence that the Knights Templar visited Nova Scotia. A metal detector also uncovered an old jewellery fragment, which contained a 500-year-old Rhodolite Garnet stone, whilst the Money Pit gave up two human bones.</p><p>DNA sequencing revealed one of the bones came from someone with Middle Eastern ancestry, boosting the link with the Knights Templar and Oak Island. A piece of leather was also found, hinted to be from bookbinding, aiding the theory that the treasure under Oak Island could perhaps be a manuscript.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2ByJyiZqSRnLavrYysq6iqqWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
