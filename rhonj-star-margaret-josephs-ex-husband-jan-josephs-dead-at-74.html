Jan had full custody of his three children at the time. They were between the ages of 8 and 16. They also share a 26-year-old biological son.&nbsp;</p><p>The two got divorced after 19 years of marriage. Margaret had an affair with her now husband, Joe Benigno.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the show and in her book, <a href=#>Caviar Dreams, Tuna Fish Budget</a>, she spoke about how her divorce led to her being estranged from Jan’s children.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she has never mentioned any of the children’s names to protect their privacy. Her son has never appeared on the show either. She always maintained that <a href=#>her kids were off-limits.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Margaret said she still considered her former husband like family</h2><p>Margaret has always been adamant that she and her ex shared a wonderful relationship despite their divorce. She said that she considered him like family and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>She echoed the same sentiment in her caption as she wrote, “He was my family.”</p><p>She also touched upon the different hats Jan wore and what he meant to different people.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Margaret wrote</a>, “Jan was an amazing father, grandfather, friend, partner to his girlfriend.
