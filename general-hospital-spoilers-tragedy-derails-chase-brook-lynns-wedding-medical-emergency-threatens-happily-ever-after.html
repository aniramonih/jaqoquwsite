Although Brook Lynn initially had some reservations about accepting Chase’s proposal, he convinced her that he truly wanted to marry her.</p><p>However, there were some troubling clues in the December 4 episode that we should talk about.</p><p>It seems like GH writers were dropping some big hints about a life-threatening crisis that could affect Brook Lynn and Chase’s future.</p><p>For starters, Chase assured Brook Lynn that he wanted to spend the rest of their lives together – long or short.</p><p>That led to Chase opening up about Gregory Chase’s (Gregory Harrison) diagnosis and how it made him realize that he didn’t want to waste today waiting for a tomorrow that might never come.</p><p>Brook Lynn eventually accepted the ring Chase picked out and insisted she’d wear it for as long as they both lived.</p><p>That was a sweet declaration, but it almost seems ominous when you pair it up with Chase’s dialogue.</p><p>Of course, it’s possible Chase is genuinely realizing how short life can be due to what’s going on with Gregory.</p><p>That’d be understandable considering Gregory is dealing with ALS, which is destined to rob him of so much time.</p><p>On the other hand, it’s common for soapy conversations like this one to contain clues about where the story’s headed.</p><p>Chase’s focus on the fact that their lives could be short seems unsettling, especially when Brook Lynn’s sort of echoing the idea.</p><p>Naturally, that doesn’t mean that Brook Lynn or Chase will necessarily face a grim fate. It could just as easily be a situation where one of them faces a medical emergency and almost loses his or her life.</p><p>Under the circumstances, Chase is probably in the most danger since he has such a risky job at the PCPD.</p><p>Brook Lynn has already been worried about the possibility of Chase getting hurt at work, so GH writers might lean into that and put Chase’s life at stake.</p><p>Somewhere down the line, Brook Lynn may find herself begging Chase to survive at his hospital bedside. Brook Lynn may fear they’ll never make it to the altar and push Chase to pull through so they can truly enjoy their happily ever after.</p><p>There’s even a chance Brook Lynn could get caught in some danger instead – leaving Chase to plead for his wife-to-be’s survival.</p><p>One way or another, General Hospital spoilers say Chase and Brook Lynn’s wedding could be in jeopardy, so stick with us for updates on whether drama will affect their engagement news.</p><p>CDL will have all the hottest <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, news and updates you’re looking for, so stop by often.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aqqaeZobKzv4ytqZqflZnGbrDEq5iipKNisKmt0p5km6qfpLhuuNinpaxlp5qxpbXNoGSmnZSesKK4jJ6knqqXmrukxYytn6udkamyr7%2BMoZipqJmhxm6x1Z6pZpmWqbKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
