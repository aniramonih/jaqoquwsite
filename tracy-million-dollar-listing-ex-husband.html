She wed Jason Maltas, a construction manager, in 2005 after four years of dating. Jason graduated from Arizona State University in 1993, and his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn page</a> lists that his current job is as the Vice President of Gordon Gibson Construction.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason does not appear to have any public social media accounts, and he's evidently retreated from the spotlight since his divorce from Tracy.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout Season 10, it was evident that Tracy and her then-husband were struggling to find time to spend with one another. Though they were both dedicated to their daughters, the two were clashing in their marriage.</p><p>It, therefore, wasn't a total surprise, when Tracy's finale update included the news of her divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>"Tracy's been expanding her business & landed her first new development in West Hollywood. She recently filed for divorce from her husband Jason. They're both committed to co-parenting and their primary focus remains their two daughters," her finale update read in 2018's Season 10.</p><p>She later explained on the show that the hardest part of the divorce was not getting to see her girls every day.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Happy Birthday Baby!!! @jmaltini you are an incredible father, friend, and husband.
