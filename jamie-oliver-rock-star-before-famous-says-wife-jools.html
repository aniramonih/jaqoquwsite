He was 17 or 18 and in a band, he invited me to a gig so I went along to some sweaty disgusting place and I went along to watch, and then we all got on the bus home and then that was it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2a481b6e9f9c-jamie-oliver-rock-star-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eM3cv2Om3VJ data-wc=10><strong>Jamie Oliver was a rock star before he was famous!</strong></p><p id=eWDm380W1Jd data-wc=54>Jools continued: "He was quite popular so I thought 'I want a piece of that', and he was very cool and the man about town.

Last month, Jamie made a surprising confession about his celebrity status, admitting to The Guardian that he doesn’t actually like being famous. "Every day I wish I wasn’t famous," he said. The star then went on to add that he recognises his fortunate position, and that he enjoys working with "nice people" as "having a laugh is a pretty good job to have".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3d6608704f12-jamie-oliver-children-wife-jools-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ekKlSHee2h7D data-wc=15><strong>Jamie and Jools Oliver met as teenagers and have gone on to welcome five children</strong></p><p id=eSYWxMS_NTsQ><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Jools Oliver shows off dance moves at music festival</a></p><p id=eW2dDwfexInv data-wc=109>Jamie and Jools have been married since June 2000, and have gone on to welcome five children between the ages of 16 and one. Last year, Jools gave an insight into her and Jamie’s long-lasting romance when she took to Instagram to share a photo of a pile of love letters Jamie had written when they were teenagers. Jools wrote: "When I was 17 I worked in Tokyo for 3 months and every single day Jamie sent me a letter or a fax without fail! These are only half of them. I started reading them and it brought back just the best and happiest memories xxx missing u @jamieoliver."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
