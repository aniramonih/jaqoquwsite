The metallic gown was made up of a cinched corset embellished with flowers as the skirt was transparent. She wore a grey sweater over the top - another nod to Margiela's show which saw models coyly draped in cardigans over their elaborate costumes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a338427a2d1d-snapinstaapp442386731186219776110606598818359517486706920n1080.jpg><p id=eSfVz9iUbJ1 data-wc=42>Many people presumed, due to the extreme silhouette, that Kim had surgery removing ribs. One fan commented below the recent behind-the-scenes post on Instagram, asking: "How many ribs have you had removed?" Others debated whether the sweater improved or ruined the look.</p><p id=eNy79dP4VbD data-wc=28>But as Kim made it clear that she'd spent the evening staggering about in what looked like the most uncomfortable shoes ever, many fans were simply in awe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/513f1261588c-snapinstaapp435989598186219775570606592068062609381187619n1080.jpg><p id=eJZLMpw-5L5 data-wc=22>Her sister, <a class=hm-link href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a>, wrote: "Damsel in distress. That invisible heel is wild! How did you manage? I definitely would have fallen".</p><p id=eKyEEevgQNc data-wc=20><a class=hm-link href=#>Serena Williams</a> concurred: "The heel though. I think I would have made a mistake and fell flat on my back."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9e4fe4b6026d-snapinstaapp441542875186219776290606593169187560230150743n1080.jpg><p id=eFQuZvVsgzm data-wc=26>"The corset AND the shoes??! Girl, how do you do it…" a fan added. Another commented: "Girl, the corset AND the heel-less shoes? Pick a struggle!"</p><p id=eBJ-o30Iey2 data-wc=63>The Met Gala's dress code was simply titled "The Garden Of Time", inspired by author J.G. Ballard's short story about an aristocratic couple besieged while living in a beautiful villa. They have a garden of crystal time flowers, which when picked turn back time and delay the mob pursuing them. Kim's dress arguably represented the crystal time flowers written about in the tale.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
