From sitting <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>front-row</a> at each other’s premieres to collaborating behind the scenes, these brothers support each other, no matter when or where. Learn everything you need to know about the talented and close-knit trio, below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/owen-wilson-siblings-SS-embed.jpg><h2><strong><strong><b>Andrew Wilson</b></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/owen-wilson-andrew-siblings-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The eldest of the bunch, Andrew Wilson was born to parents <strong>Laura</strong> and <strong>Robert Wilson</strong> in 1964. An actor and director himself, Andrew has had his fair share of roles, acting in films like the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Drew-Barrymore</strong></a> directed&nbsp;Whip It, <i>Fever Pitch </i>with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a>, and 2017’s Time Trap. Throughout his career, Andrew has shared the screen with his brothers on many occasions. Andrew has had a role in multiple <strong>Wes Anderson</strong> films alongside Owen, including&nbsp;Bottle Rocket,&nbsp;Rushmore, and&nbsp;The Royal Tenenbaums.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In 2006’s&nbsp;Idiocracy, Andrew shared the screen with his brother Luke. With 2005’s The Wendell Baker Story, Andrew was able to combine all his passions: directing, acting, and collaborating with his brothers. Andrew co-directed the film with Luke, who also had a starring role alongside Owen. With&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Eva Mendes</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Kris Kristofferson&nbsp;</strong>rounding out the cast, the movie even fittingly premiered in the brothers’ home state of Texas, at the 2005 South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin.</p><h2><strong><strong><b>Luke Wilson</b></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/owen-wilson-luke-siblings-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Though Luke may have been born with two big pairs of shoes to fill, the successful actor and director has had no problem making his own way in the industry. Even the most casual film fan may remember Luke for his starring role in&nbsp;Legally Blonde as Emmett, the know-it-all law student who eventually captures the heart of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a>‘s iconic Elle Woods.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Luke’s also done critically acclaimed work in some less-famous movies as well, including&nbsp;Henry Poole Is Here, Death at a Funeral,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Goldfinch&nbsp;alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ansel Elgort</strong></a>. Along with inheriting his brothers’ passion for film, Luke also shares their penchant for collaborating together. He even <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>revealed plans</a> to <strong>Larry King</strong> in 2014 for a Wright Brother’s biopic he and Owen had written, but nothing has been released…yet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/owen-wilson-siblings-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Whether an unreleased Wright Brothers biopic or a classic like&nbsp;The Royal Tenenbaums, the Wilson brothers have shown time and time again they’re at their best together. Supporting each other’s endeavors and working together whenever they can, this trio proves sibling rivalry really can be all love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme86wnKdlp565tLvNZqqimpyeu6i%2FjG1tbW1ja4Bw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
