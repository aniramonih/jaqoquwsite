During Season 1 of Seeking Sister Wife, Dimitri Snowden and his wife Ashley did not have any luck when it came to courting their potential second wife, Joselyn. During Season 2, it seemed as though a beautiful woman named Vanessa Cobbs had answered their prayers... but then she left, and Dimitri and Ashley were back at square one."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"When Ashley and I met, I told her my vision for my family was to have more than one wife," Dimitri said on the show. "When people think polygamy, they think Mormon, they think Utah. We're not Mormon and we certainly don't live in Utah and we're people of color... I want a noisy house, babies everywhere, I just want an epically big family."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's no surprise that after discovering that Dimitri wants nine kids (he and Ashley have three already) that viewers were interested to find out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Dimitri does for a living</a> to support his current brood.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what does Dimitri do for a living?&nbsp;</h2><p>Dimitri owns an IT company — that is actually how he met Ashley, who was teaching at the time and her computer was always breaking — and according to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram bio</a>, he is an ontological architect.</p><p>In case you don't know what an ontological architect is, it is basically an architect who uses artificial intelligence to better understand the world around you. "Dimitri designs experiences that will influence how you interact with the world around you," reads his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. "Literally, the experiences he designs will design you back. Dimitri’s multi-disciplinary approach creates impactful experiences&nbsp;for some of the world’s leading brands."</p><p>Some of his past projects include developing a lithium-ion double a, micro USB rechargeable battery, and creating the nation's first charter school with a wind farm. &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Along with his impressive career, Dimitri is also proficient in taekwondo, muay thai, and American boxing.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Dimitri Snowden's net worth?</h2><p>Between his gig as a reality TV star and being a successful entrepreneur, it's safe to say that Dimitri is making enough money to live a pretty comfortable lifestyle. He currently has an estimated net worth of $1–3 million. Ashley also adds some wealth to the household net worth. She has an M.A. in Teaching and works as a spiritual herbalist, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her website</a> (which we have to assume Dimitri helped build!).</p><p>Ashley offers "workshops, advising sessions, and natural health products that speak directly to women on a mission to transcend societal expectations and thrive" — and naturally, each of those offerings cost money. It appears she also runs an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Etsy storefront</a> where she sells various tinctures and balms.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Vanessa leave the Snowdens on 'Seeking Sister Wife'?</h2><p>When Vanessa didn't appear on Season 3 of Seeking Sister Wife, people had questions. Mostly, they wanted to know what happened with her as it seemed as though Dimitri, Ashley, and Vanessa had forged a pretty strong bond in Season 2. She made a lengthy statement on Instagram in May of 2019 where she explained that she had chosen to leave the family.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was ignoring my inner guidance, which was telling me I do not belong with them in the capacity that they need me to," she said, adding, "Sometimes their long-established dynamic is not aligned with your own personal growth and path forward."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>According to Dimitri and Ashley, Vanessa left the family quite suddenly. While she was away on a trip for a friend's birthday, Dimitri and Ashley say Vanessa sent them a text saying that she wished to conclude the relationship. "I think I was blindsided by the timing and maybe the method [of the breakup], but I think for her, it had been some time brewing," Ashley said.</p><p>Watch Seeking Sister Wife Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXZm2rrXTq6Bmq56kxKWxzWabqGWcnsOqusZmqp6dm567qHnSoqqtnaJixKqyxA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
