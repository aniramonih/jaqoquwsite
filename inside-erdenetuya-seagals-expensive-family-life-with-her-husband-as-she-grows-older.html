She also worked as Steven’s assistant and eventually became acquainted with him. After five years of working as his assistant, they decided to take their relationship from professional to intimate.</p><p>In 2009, they exchanged wedding vows and began a married relationship. Erdenetuya, also known as Elle, gave birth to their only child, a son, on September 17, 2009, the same year they married and named him Kunzang Seagal.</p><p>Elle is currently spending quality time with her husband, Steven. She attends numerous events with her husband and fully supports him. They even go on vacation with their son and celebrate special occasions with him.</p><p>Erdenetuya’s positive relationship with her husband is also visible on social media. She wrote a heartfelt message for Steven’s 66th birthday in April 2018. She stated that she could not be more proud of him today for having lived such a wonderful life in which he has accomplished so much in just one lifetime. So, with luck and a loving husband, the former dancer replenishes her life as she grows older.</p><h2>Steven, her husband, was previously married three times.</h2><p>Her Husband Steven was married three times before marrying Erdenetuya, making Erdenetuya his fourth wife. The actor first married Miyako Fujitani, a Japanese Aikido instructor, in 1974. They had met in July of the same year at the Los Angeles International Airport. They had three children together, but sadly, the third child died. Their marriage was annulled in 1986.</p><p>“Once he’d gone, he’d gone… I had to raise my children in addition to running the dojo. I’m not sure how we got by. “Sometimes, we could only afford cheap brown rice for dinner,” Miyako explained in a 2000 interview with Dojo.</p><p>In 1984, Steven married his second wife, Adrienne La Russa, an actress best known for her role in the soap opera Days of Our Lives. Their marriage, however, lasted only a few years before they divorced in 1986.</p><p>He married for the third time the following year, in 1987, to actress Kelly LeBrock. LeBrock is best known for her role in the film Weird Science. She also appeared alongside Steven in the action film Hard to Kill.</p><p>They had three children together: two daughters, Annaliza Seagal and Arissa LeBrock, and a son, Dominic Seagal. Steven and Kelly divorced in 1996, nearly ten years into their marriage, citing “irreconcilable differences.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Erdenetuya-Batsukh-1.jpg><h2>Allegations of Sexual Assault Against Erdenetuya’s Husband</h2><p>Erdenetuya’s otherwise happy life has been marred by numerous sexual misconduct allegations leveled against her husband. Erdenetuya’s husband was one of the celebrities accused of sexual misconduct during the height of Hollywood’s #MeToo movement. His history with sexual misconduct, on the other hand, predates his marriage to her.</p><p>Erdenetuya’s husband was involved in a $1 million sexual harassment lawsuit against his former assistant Kayden Nguyen around the time of their marriage. But it wasn’t the first time he’d been accused. Actresses Jenny McCarthy and Cheryl Shuman had accused Stephen of harassment and assault long before he met his now-wife.</p><p>Steven was already embroiled in three lawsuits and a slew of accusations, and more cases emerged during the #MeToo movement. During a recent BBC interview, he walked out on the interviewer before she could finish her question about his rape allegations.</p><p>Despite the overwhelming number of allegations, the actor has maintained that he is innocent of them. Erdenetuya, on the other hand, has remained silent, whether because she is loyal to her husband or unaware of what is going on.</p><h2>Erdenetuya has a sizable net worth thanks to her actor husband</h2><p>Whatever happens with her husband on the outside, Elle’s inside married life is adorned with luxury thanks to Steven’s sizable net worth.</p><p>He is one of Hollywood’s most well-known actors and has also directed, written, and produced projects in the entertainment industry. He is also a martial artist skilled in various arts such as Karate, Judo, Kendo, and Aikido.</p><p>With over three decades of industry experience, the Under Siege actor has more than 50 acting credits to his name, which has helped him amass a net worth of $16 million as of August 2023.</p><h2>Her bio: She is the best dancer in her country</h2><p>Erdenetuya was born in Mongolia as Erdenetuya Batsukh and is better known as Elle. Her parents, siblings, and family are all unknown at this time. Her age and birthday are also unknown to the media. However, it came to light that she began taking dancing lessons at the Children’s Palace in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, at a very young age.</p><p>Elle became a professional dancer after finishing high school and training. Later, she competed in numerous dancing competitions, winning numerous titles. She became one of her country’s top dancers and topped in ballroom dance thanks to her dancing abilities and skills.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Erdenetuya Seagal</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Miyako Fujitani</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigp6uZmbJusdGdnKedpKrGonnSnpigmZyoeqbEz56lrKGmmnqnrcyio7JlnJ6zpnnWoquhZZiav2601KyZmqaUYq60edKhnGafoqTEtHnOpZueql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
