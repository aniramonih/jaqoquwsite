I just think he’s good at keeping his personal life under wraps. That is until he gets someone pregnant. Owen is said to be expecting a baby with his personal trainer, a still-married woman that he’s known for six years named Caroline Lindqvist. Supposedly Caroline was legally separated and living apart from her plastic surgeon husband when she started sleeping with Owen. According to the upcoming issue of the National Enquirer, Caroline’s pregnancy was an accident which Owen, and Caroline’s husband, were rather surprised to find out about. This will be Owen’s second child, he has a <a href=#>two year-old son</a> with an <a href=#>ex girlfriend</a> named Jade Duell.</p><p>Owen Wilson is becoming a father for the second time, but his second baby mama is a married woman who just filed for divorce in May!</p><p>According to a new report from the National ENQUIRER, Wilson, 44, is secretly preparing for the January birth of his child with 42-year-old Swedish-born ballerina Caroline Lindqvist.</p><p>Lindqvist has been separated for more than a year from Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, Dr. Ritu Chopra.</p><p>The ENQUIRER reports that Wilson met Lindqvist shortly after his breakup from actress Kate Hudson and 2007 suicide attempt.</p><p>The Wedding Crashers hired Lindqvist at the time to be his personal trainer and the friendship eventually evolved into a sexual relationship.</p><p>“Caroline broke the news to Owen this past May shortly after confirming that he was the father,” a source told the magazine.</p><p>“A few days later she filed for divorce from her husband.”</p><p>Star magazine reports that Wilson and Lindqvist dated while she was legally married.</p><p>But, the couple had been physically and legally separated before their relationship began.</p><p>“Ritu was completely blindsided by the news of Caroline’s pregnancy,” the source said.</p><p>Wilson had a son with then-girlfriend Jade Duell two years ago but they split after five months.</p><p><a href=#>[From Radar Online]</a></p><p>I found this woman on Facebook. Ten to one she makes her profile more private soon, and I’m not going to link it or put up her picture, you can <a href=#>see that on Radar anyway</a>. She’s from Sweden and often posts in Swedish. (It’s not just some other person with the same name, she does personal training in LA.) From what little I could see of her, she doesn’t look like a plastic surgeon’s wife, like say, Adrienne Maloof. She’s very natural looking.</p><p>I believe this, as there’s plenty of detail and The Enquirer has run insider stories about Owen for years, particularly about his last relationship.</p><p>It’s hard to tell from this excerpt whether Owen and Caroline are or were serious or whether they were just casual. I bet Owen thought it was casual. This situation reminds me of Simon Cowell and his knocked-up girlfriend filing for divorce, only this woman was already separated. (Allegedly.) Like Simon, I think Owen made sure to confirm paternity. Whatever is going on, I hope that Owen does the right thing and is in the child’s life. Personally, I would love to see him coupled up but I don’t think that’s what he wants.</p><p><a href=#><img alt="Los Angeles Premiere of 'The Internship'" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wenn20396993-752x1024.jpg width=500 sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img alt="Los Angeles Premiere 'The Internship'" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wenn20397037-746x1024.jpg width=500 sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img alt="2013 CinemaCon Big Screen Achievement Awards" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wenn20281617-770x1024.jpg width=500 sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Owen is shown at the premiere of The Internship in May and in April at Cinemacon</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbGpnbH9ze86wnKeXp565tLvNmKCsl5Wtvaav06KloJeRlK%2BirtiYrqKsmJS1qr%2B%2BppirqpmasaC8xKuqqKaRoay1vsCipZ6qXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
