However, the fact that she is married was her best-kept secret until now.&nbsp;According to the TikTok star, irreconcilable differences are to blame for the breakup. It‚Äôs interesting that Bella hasn‚Äôt posted any photos or videos of her and her fiance on her TikTok or Instagram pages and there don‚Äôt appear to be any pictures of her wearing a wedding ring, either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Bella-Poarch-1.jpg><p>The divorce papers claim that she and Tyler wed in January of this year. Furthermore, she appeared to be in high spirits two days prior to the wedding as evidenced by an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> photo of her posing for a mirror flick. It‚Äôs possible that she previously posted photos of Tyler but has since deleted them. If so, she did a fantastic job because she apparently left no traces of her impending ex.</p><p>They did not have any children together so she has no interest in receiving spousal support from either of them.&nbsp;In April 2020, Bella made her first TikTok upload. The video she made became the most popular one on the platform catapulting her to fame.
