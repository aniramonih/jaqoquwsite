One such song that has resonated with me is “Judgement Day” by Stealth. I remember stumbling upon this song at a friend’s house, and from the moment it started playing, I was captivated by its haunting melody and powerful lyrics.</p><p>The lyrics of “Judgement Day” speak volumes about the inner struggle we all face when confronted with our own mistakes and regrets. The opening lines, “I can feel the floor shaking, and the glass begin to break, the air is getting thinner with every breath that I take,” beautifully describe the overwhelming sense of impending doom and guilt that the protagonist experiences.</p><p>The song delves further into the turmoil within, as Stealth sings, “Of all the love I have taken, all the hearts I’ve turned to hate, hearts are easily broken when you’ve been made in the shade.” These lyrics suggest a deep self-awareness of the pain and hurt caused by the protagonist’s actions, highlighting the internal battle between right and wrong.</p><p>One striking aspect of “Judgement Day” is the raw honesty in its lyrics. The chorus boldly declares, “Strike me down, take me away, debts are due, it’s time to pay, face what I deserve, here comes judgement day.” This plea for accountability and acceptance of consequences is both powerful and relatable.</p><p>Throughout the song, there is a clear acknowledgment of crossing boundaries and the need for redemption. The lyrics, “I’ve crossed every line, broken every boundary, and now it’s retribution time, ’cause the church that I went to, it ain’t that holy,” reflect the protagonist’s realization that they must confront their past actions head-on.</p><p>The bridge of the song offers a glimmer of hope, suggesting that it’s not too late to cleanse one’s soul. “Standing at the gate, ready to meet my fate, cleanse my soul, it’s not too late, so bring on judgement day.” This ray of optimism amidst the turmoil shows that there is always a chance for redemption and personal growth.</p><p>“Judgement Day” was released as part of the album “Intro – EP” in 2016. The song was written by Shaun Smith, Ross O’Reilly, and Stealth himself. It features additional instruments by Ross O’Reilly and vocal production by Angela Ricci. The song, with its soulful vocals and emotive piano, creates a captivating ambiance that perfectly complements the weightiness of the lyrics.</p><p>In conclusion, “Judgement Day” by Stealth is a deeply introspective song that explores themes of guilt, redemption, and personal growth. Its powerful lyrics and haunting melody make it a compelling piece that resonates with anyone who has faced their own inner demons. Listening to this song is not only a musical experience but also a journey of self-reflection and acceptance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jrBpaKyYmnquscCnoKefXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwLC6xmahrpyXmrqmutNmm5qxXZfGbr%2FTnpilrJhk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
