Years after they appeared on the show, viewers are eager to know where they are now. Some rumors suggest that Dashaun is dead. But is there any truth to the speculations?

According to Jon, the moment was just as heartbreaking for him as it was for viewers. The reality TV star declined to share any personal information about Dashaun to protect his privacy, but he assured fans of the series that he was “rallying to help him out!”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I think my biggest concern is that Dashaun will eventually get out of jail and back on the streets without resources,” Jon commented on a 60 Days In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a> back in 2017. “If you grow up impoverished, and now you're a convict with even less opportunity than before, of course the majority are going to return to criminal activity in order to survive.”</p><p>He emphasized that Dashaun’s legal woes were proof that he “never had anyone to guide him in a positive manner.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>However, it’s unclear if the two are still in touch today.</p><p>It seems that Dashaun was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released</a> from prison in June of 2022, as he's no longer listed as an inmate in the prison’s current system.
