During a discussion with her Fox & Friends co-host <strong>Brian Kilmeade</strong> and Blacksphere executive director <strong>Kevin Jackson</strong>, the conservative TV host, 38, wondered aloud why the movement hasn’t yet been deemed a “hate group.”</p><p>Hasselbeck and her colleagues were reviewing video from Minnesota, where a group of protesters carrying “Black Lives Matter” signs referred to police as “pigs in a blanket” and chanted, “Fry ’em like bacon.” The protest occurred on Saturday, Aug. 29, one day after Texas deputy <strong>Darren Goforth</strong> was shot and killed by <strong>Shannon Miles</strong>, a black man with a history of mental illness, according to <a href=#>CNN</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Friday events were tragic and certainly a stain on the nation. Saturday is pretty much par for the course these days,” Jackson, who is black, said on the Aug. 31 episode of Fox & Friends. “If you recall, they had the same chant a while back when another officer was killed. And then of course we had the officer that got beat up on camera, and they filmed him.”</p><p>“The unfortunate thing is,” he added, “the Black Lives Matter movement, which can only be described as nonsense, is creating a lot of this type of thing around the country. And it’s gonna backfire, quite honestly.”</p><p>Hasselbeck then posed this controversial question to the conservative commentator: “Kevin, why has the Black Lives movement — the Black Lives Matter movement — not been classified yet as a hate group? I mean, how much more has to go in this direction before someone actually labels it as such?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Jackson replied that it “should” be, but that it’s “being financed by the leftists. And ironically, it’s people that have really no concern at all about black lives. People like George Soros.”</p><p>He continued: “The sad part about it is the impact that it’s gonna have on the black community and the fact that it takes away so much thought about what really is the problem in the black community, which is the lack of whole black families. And what it allows people to do is sort of say, ‘Hey, let’s point the finger at everything but where it really needs to point.’ If we had more black families whole in the community, we would have a lot less of this. If we had clergy who were willing to support real issues and change in the black community, we’d have a lot less of this.”</p><p>He further claimed that most of the black community is against the Black Lives Matter movement. “The overwhelming majority of blacks in America want what every other human being wants in America, white, black, or otherwise, and they do not support this movement,” he said. “It’s something like 64 percent against it.”</p><p>Not surprisingly, Hasselbeck’s comments incited backlash on Twitter. One person wrote that she had the “IQ of a sponge,” while another suggested she and her Fox & Friends colleagues should be categorized as a “hate group.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Hasselbeck tweeted about the show on Tuesday, Sept. 1.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>My calling <a href=#>@foxandfriends</a> is to ask questions and my calling as a <a href=#>#Christian</a> is to <a href=#>#LoveAllGodsPeople</a> -I give my best to do both each day.</p><p>— elisabeth hasselbeck (@ehasselbeck) <a href=#>September 1, 2015</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJyloaOWr6bAx2afmqujmrmjscKkZLCgqWK2tLrTZpmlmZOguarCxKykmqykmr9urYyhmK2dXZy%2FsMHPZmlpaWVmhg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
