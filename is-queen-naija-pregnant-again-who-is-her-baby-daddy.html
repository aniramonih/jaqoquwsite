However, it was her YouTube channel that made her a household name in the American entertainment scene.</p><p>Her breakthrough came with the release of her single, Medicine, in 2018, which received great notice and popularity across multiple media. Following that, she continued to release music, establishing a great career in R&B and soul.</p><p>Along with all the fame, Queen Naija’s personal life has regularly been a subject of concern among her fans. Recently, we have found that many people have been wanting to know if she is pregnant again. Also, some people seek to know the baby daddy of her 2 kids. Well, here is everything you need to know.</p><p>Previously, we discussed the&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>relationship status</a></strong>&nbsp;of <a href=#><strong>Aryna Sabalenka</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Danny Mullen</strong></a>.</p><h2>Find Out if Queen Naija Is Pregnant Again!</h2><p><strong>Queen Naija </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@queennaija</a>), who is already a proud mother of her two children (both sons), has recently been suspected of being pregnant again. The rumor of her expecting her third child is trending all across social media, especially on Instagram.</p><p>To be honest, we were a little excited when we heard about the rumor. It has already been more than 3 years since she gave birth to her second child and we thought it was the right time to have a third one. Wasting no time, we rushed to the Internet and her Instagram to find out whether or not the rumor was true.</p><p>Unfortunately, we found nothing official regarding Queen Naija’s possible pregnancy. The 28-year-old star has not given any indication about being pregnant again. We even took a closer look at her recent Instagram pictures but couldn’t find the baby bump.</p><p>Since she has not given any statement regarding the rumor and since her pictures do not show any sign of having a baby bump, we come to the conclusion that she is not pregnant.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2024/01/is-queen-naija-pregnant-again.jpg alt="There's no evidence of Queen Naija being pregnant again. blurred-reality.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>There’s no evidence of Queen Naija being pregnant again.<br>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>On the other hand, there’s a chance that she might be pregnant but is hiding it from the public for now. Considering that she is only 28 years old and both of her children are sons, it would make sense that she and her partner are trying to have a daughter.</p><p>However, please note that the given information is completely based on our speculation. Nevertheless, stay tuned with us as we promise to respond to you as soon as we learn of any new information regarding her possible pregnancy.</p><h2>Queen Naija Has 2 Sons:&nbsp;Who Is Her Baby Daddy (Father) Though?</h2><p><strong>Queen Naija</strong> and her current partner, <strong>Clarence White </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@clarencenyc</a>), frequently post pictures of their <a href=# rel=noopener>2 children</a> on their Instagram.
