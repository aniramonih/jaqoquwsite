But getting someone to come in to acquire these types of things, we have seen it’s difficult at the moment with other examples, but we are doing everything we can to go and find someone,” he added.</p><p>“It’s very early in the process. We are going through our normal approach and keeping everyone up to date. It’s obviously a unique trading environment at the moment so we are doing everything we can to see where we will get to over the next phase of the process.”</p><p>In2food, which also previously traded as Yarra Valley Farms Australia, collapsed back in August 2021 blaming the “disruption of snap lockdowns in multiple states” and a “problematic retail journey” into ready to eat meals.</p><p>The company had a deal with David Jones to supply ready-to-eat meals to BP service stations, which failed.</p><p>The business had distributed fresh farm foods to supermarkets, hospitals, aged care, retailers, airlines and restaurants and had sites in every part of Australia except Tasmania.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Documents released in September 2021 revealed the company owed $53 million to creditors, including small businesses.</p><p>It continued to trade while in administration and was thrown a lifeline in October 2021 when it was bought by Produce Republic – the owner of Aussie Frozen Fruit – which also saved 400 jobs.</p><p>The company was sold site unseen due to travel restrictions preventing the new owners from conducting a national tour of plants in person to inspect equipment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2S8tbTEq2SippSqwLW%2ByJ6qaJmlqMGzrcuimKdlmaN%2Fp7vOnWScp52lrq%2FFjJympaSRpcCmv4yfpqtlo5qwsLrDZquipZVixKrAx2ZpaaVdnrtusMSbq2ZpYGV9bq%2FRnpuirJ%2BnwHC6xLCqZqukpL%2B6e5Kba59vlmqxprKQnGtpaZRnhKWDlpyZnGmUa4Z5rcFu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
