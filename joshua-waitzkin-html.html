He was also inspired to write his 1984 book&nbsp;Searching For Bobby Fischer&nbsp;which was an internationally acclaimed bestseller. Later in 1993, the book was turned into a movie of&nbsp;the same name. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Talking about his son’s talent in his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2013 interview with Scientific American</a>, the author revealed&nbsp;that his son always had a passion for chess, and they bonded great through the game as well.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>He confessed to not forcing him to play the after-school park games or teach him to be a competitor.&nbsp;But as his parents, he and his wife had to remind Joshua to study and practice.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Reminiscing those times, the proud father also mentioned that it was a team of three, and as suggested in some parts of the movie, sometimes he would push Joshua a bit too hard, at which point his wife would always push back at him.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I think we were a great team of three. Josh was the player—a one in a million talent… We loved our lives in the chess wars. Bonnie loved Josh’s chess greatly but also she brought some sanity to the table. If I pushed him too hard, she pushed back at me.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>The Reason Why He Moved Away From Chess</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">In his 2007&nbsp;NPR interview</a>, the chess prodigy revealed&nbsp;why he decided to take a break from chess.
