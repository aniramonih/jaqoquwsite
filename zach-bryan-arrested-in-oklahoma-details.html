Bryan addressed his arrest via social media. 
“Today I had an incident with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. Emotions got the best of me and I was out of line in the things I said,” Bryan claimed via X (formally known as Twitter). “I support law enforcement as much as anyone can, I was just frustrated in the moment, it was unlike me and I apologize. They brought me to jail, and there is a mug shot of me floating around."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He was reportedly released on bail shortly after his arrest, according to<a href=#> Rolling Stone</a>.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1531534474.jpg><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Hours <a href=#>before being detained</a>, Bryan shared a photo via Instagram of farmland outside a car window. The singer-songwriter, who was seemingly behind the wheel with his dog in the passenger seat, captioned the photo, “On the road again, gonna go see the birds win.”<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Last month, Bryan announced<a href=#> he would be hitting the road for his 2024 tour</a>. “This year was too much fun, thank you guys so much for making our lives a dream,” he wrote via Instagram in August. “Boys are headed home and gearin’ up.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Bryan’s upcoming venture, called The Quittin Time Tour, will kick off in March 2024 in Chicago and feature special guest performances from <a href=#><strong>Sheryl Crow</strong></a>, <strong>Levi Turner</strong> and The Middle East, <strong>Sierra Ferrell</strong> and more. The concerts will continue through December 2024 and wrap up in Bryan’s home city of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The announcement comes on the heels of Bryan’s Burn Burn Burn American Tour, which wrapped up on August 30 in Kansas City, Missouri.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Earlier this summer, Bryan made headlines for something other than his music. The “Something in the Orange” singer turned heads when he was linked to <a href=#>Barstool Sports personality<strong> Brianna LaPaglia</strong></a>.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">LaPaglia, 24 — a.k.a. Brianna Chickenfry — addressed the relationship speculation on a July episode of her “<a href=#>PlanBri Uncut</a>” podcast. “It’s fun, it’s casual, and yeah, I just wanted to address it because the whole internet is freaking the f—k out and people are doing s—t,” she said, confirming that she was seeing Bryan. “And yeah, that’s really it. Just hanging out, having some fun.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The pair first sparked romance speculation in June when they were <a href=#>seen in a TikTok video</a> together with friends. They added fuel to the fire later that month when LaPaglia joined Bryan on stage at Forest Hills Stadium in New York City for a performance of “Revival” during his&nbsp;Burn Burn Burn American Tour.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">LaPaglia went on to call the online <a href=#>conversation surrounding her personal life</a> “crazy,” telling her podcast cohost,&nbsp;<strong>Grace O’Malley</strong>, “For some reason, I thought I was never gonna have to say it. I thought it was gonna be, like, the one thing from the internet that I could keep a secret.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">She continued: “It just sucks with the internet how they speculate and s—t with timelines and stuff. And yeah, it’s just stupid, so I figured I’d just say it before the whole internet gets to say who I am and what I’m doing.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">It’s unknown if LaPaglia was with Bryan at the time of his arrest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGazmZOdeqO%2B2JqlZpmip7K0wMSdZKKmXaS4ra3HqKSaZZSawaK1y6xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
