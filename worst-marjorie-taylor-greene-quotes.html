In any case, the congresswoman has amassed quite a list of dishearteningly memorable quotes, and, regrettably, there’s enough for a top 10 list.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-doj-and-democrats-used-j6-to-target-and-persecute-maga-americans-plain-simple data-injectable=false>“DOJ and Democrats used J6 to target and persecute MAGA Americans.

There’s been complaints of it tasting like cleaner.”</h2><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>As the January 6 rioters continued to immerse themselves in the “find out” phase of their storming of the Capitol, Greene <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">aired concerns</a> about the prisoners’ food allegedly tasting like cleaner.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>This isn’t to say that food tasting like cleaner isn’t a problem, but right now, we’re a bit occupied by the astronomically high chances that this is the first time Greene has shown any concern for the state of prison food, or the out-and-out evil state of the United States’ prison system at all.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>“If Steve Bannon and I had organized that, we would have won. Not to mention, it would’ve been armed.”</h2><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>Greene <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has claimed</a> that the January 6 attacks were actually a peaceful protest, but apparently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she believes</a> that was only because she and Steve Bannon weren’t involved.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>What’s your angle here, Greene? Not only were the protestors <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to be armed</a>, meaning someone had actually beaten you to your retroactive plan of arming your alleged peaceful protestors, but, in your mind, you have the image of a victory of some sort.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>We’re not sure what “winning” means in the context of armed, “peaceful” protestors, and we don’t have the slightest desire to learn what that might be.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>“Rather than providing the best service possible to the American taxpayer, the Biden Admin. is focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion.”</h2><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>This quote is actually quite interesting, because the state of language’s dissolution in the realm of American politics is on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">full display here</a>.</p><p data-characters=637 data-current-count=974 data-injectable=true>All of this to say that words don’t mean things anymore as far as Greene seems to be concerned. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are not being used here to denote the meanings and subsequent values that these words actually stand for, but instead to simply paint the Democratic Party with the brush that the party uses for itself quite regularly. In other words, if the Democratic Party (which, to the conspiracy-feasting Republican, means nothing other than “bad”) are proponents of diversity, equity, and inclusion (itself a questionable take, but I digress), then diversity, equity, and inclusion must be bad, right?</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>These nuances are entirely demoralizing to witness, of course, but now we’re just curious how one might explain the ways in which diversity, equity, and inclusion are inherently bad things without dipping into sheer ideological balderdash.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>“I will not be voting to fund the FBI and DOJ unless the two-tiered justice system is stopped.”</h2><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>We said earlier how Greene has transcended the possibility of satirization. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The leap</a> from Jane Fonda expressing an understandably volatile sentiment for the recent Roe vs. Wade developments to Greene intending to defund the FBI is one of the two crown jewels of that transcendence.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>“Bullshit!”</h2><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>We admire Greene’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">attempt</a> to flip the script by accusing Homeland Security of utilizing her signature tool, but there’s a time and a place for it, and neither of them can be found at a classified briefing (or anywhere, for that matter).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>“… the “insurrection” lie about a 3 hour riot at the Capitol that was likely incited by some Fed operatives, Antifa, and a few bad actors.”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hilarious!!<br>Bennie Thompson, former chair of the politically weaponized January 6th committee, says Democrats aren’t going to McAllen, TX today for our Homeland Security Committee hearing tomorrow on the border because Republicans won’t be bipartisan.<br>Facts don’t lie about our… <a href=#>https://t.co/VRWf2lYSis</a></p>— Rep.

Is she saying she would have armed the rioters, the Fed operatives, the Antifa players, and the aforementioned bad apples? And if they “won,” as she put it, would that not mean that she basically teamed up with Antifa in the process?</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>We’re starting to think that Greene isn’t terribly concerned with the notion of cohesion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>“President Trump and the J6 Prison Choir’s new song, “Justice for All,” is #1 everywhere.”</h2><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This</a> is the second crown jewel of that aforementioned transcendence, and this perhaps edges out her intention to defund the FBI by way of sheer dystopian energy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>“ABC, this threat of violence against me by [Jimmy Kimmel] has been filed with the Capitol Police.”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@ABC</a>, this threat of violence against me by <a href=#>@jimmykimmel</a> has been filed with the <a href=#>@CapitolPolice</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nxYX1LF2jK</a></p>— Rep.

Let’s put aside the possible ramifications of the country’s heinous two-party setup trying to find its feet in the chaos of dissolution, and let’s put aside how terrifying a country could be in the hands of an entirely unobstructed Republican government, regardless of how America’s resources could hypothetically be divvied up.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>On second thought, let’s not put any of this aside, and call it out for what it is; a pathetic admission of not wanting to see the world beyond the space that her tightly-wound mind occupies, a desire that she selfishly tries to pin on the people she was somehow given the privilege of serving.</p><p data-characters=55 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>No, let’s never put any of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a> aside ever again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEsL7SrWSmmaKfvLO1xGarmrGcpL9us9GenKedXabCsMDErGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
