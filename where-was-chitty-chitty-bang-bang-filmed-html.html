Today, let’s take a whimsical journey back to 1968 and explore the enchanting world of “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.” Directed by Ken Hughes and produced by the legendary Albert R. Broccoli, this musical-fantasy is a delightful adaptation of Ian Fleming’s children’s novel, boasting a star-studded cast featuring Dick Van Dyke, Sally Ann Howes, and Benny Hill, among others.</p><p>Now, let’s spill the beans on the magical locations that set the stage for this timeless classic. Picture this: it’s June 1967, and the cameras start rolling at Pinewood Studios in England. The Duck Pond scene, where Truly takes a dive, was shot in the charming Russell’s Water, Oxfordshire. The Potts Windmill and Cottage, complete with the Cobstone Windmill, came to life in Ibstone near Turville, Buckinghamshire. And guess what? The exterior of the Scrumptious Sweet Co. factory found its home at Kempton Park Waterworks in Hanworth, Greater London – it’s a museum now, can you believe it?</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Now, let’s talk about the grandeur! Heatherden Hall at Pinewood Studios in Iver Heath transformed into the majestic Scrumptious Mansion. But wait, the adventure doesn’t stop there. The film spread its wings internationally, capturing scenes at Cap Taillat in Saint-Tropez, France. The spies’ attempts to blow up Chitty? That happened at the Grade II-listed Iver Bridge in Buckinghamshire. And don’t get me started on the kidnapping of Lord Scrumptious – it went down at Ilmer Bridge, part of the Chiltern Main Line.</p><p>The scenic diversity of “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” extends from the cliffs of Beachy Head in East Sussex to the white rock spires and lighthouse on the Isle of Wight. Baron Bomburst’s castle exterior? None other than the stunning Neuschwanstein Castle in West Germany. And if you were charmed by the quaint Vulgarian village scenes, those unfolded in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Bavaria, West Germany. Talk about a cinematic world tour!</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the heart of the story. Caractacus Potts, played by the ever-charismatic Dick Van Dyke, is a kind inventor in rural England in the 1910s. Together with his two children, Jemima and Jeremy, they stumble upon a worn-out racecar destined for the scrapyard. Caractacus, undeterred by setbacks, sets out to save the car, earning money through inventive schemes like a musical hard candy invention that attracts dogs instead of customers.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>And who could forget the carnival chaos? Caractacus’s hair-cutting machine goes haywire, leading to a lively song-and-dance act and enough money to rebuild the car. Thus, “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” is born! A family picnic, a fantastical story, and a daring escape from the villainous Baron Bomburst of Vulgaria set the stage for an unforgettable adventure.</p><p>Vulgaria brings its own set of challenges, from the Baron’s disdain for children to the menacing Child Catcher. With the help of the Toymaker, the Potts family devises a plan to free the children and overthrow the tyrannical Baron. The story unfolds with a mix of adventure, song, and laughter, culminating in a triumphant return home to England. As the tale concludes, Caractacus and Truly, played by Sally Ann Howes, admit their love for each other, and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang takes flight once more, bringing joy and magic to the Potts family.</p><p>And now, let’s talk about that magical beach scene! Picture golden sands, blue waters, and a picturesque coastal setting. That’s right – the beach scene in “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” was filmed at Cap Taillat in Saint-Tropez, France. The characters, including Caractacus Potts and his children, bask in the sun, enjoying a delightful picnic by the sea. It’s a moment of pure cinematic magic that adds to the whimsical atmosphere of the story.</p><p>If you’re feeling the nostalgia and want to relive the magic, you can catch “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” on popular streaming platforms like Apple TV and Amazon Video.
