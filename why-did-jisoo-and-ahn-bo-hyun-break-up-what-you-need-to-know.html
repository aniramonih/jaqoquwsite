Kim Ji-soo (more popularly known by fans as Jisoo from South Korean girl group Blackpink) and Ahn Bo-hyun, an accomplished actor signed under FN Entertainment, made headlines around the globe through their brief relationship which garnered significant fan appreciation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Kim Ji-soo (Jisoo)?</h2><p>Kim Ji-soo, more popularly known by her stage name Jisoo, is an esteemed member of K-pop industry. Born January 3, 1995 and signed to YG Entertainment’s girl group Blackpink (formed 2016), Jisoo quickly rose to stardom as both singer and actress; making notable cameo appearances such as 2015 series “The Producers”, but truly making an impression was her leading role as Snowdrop (2021-22).

Their romance began making headlines after confirmation of their dating status, a rare and intriguing development in the K-pop world, where personal lives are often kept private. Initially reported as being in the phase of “getting to know each other with positive sentiments,” their relationship seemed to hold promise.</p><p>However, the demands of their professional lives soon became apparent. Jisoo, as part of Blackpink, had a packed schedule that included recording, touring, and promotional activities.

Similarly, Ahn Bo-hyun’s career in acting required a significant time commitment, with long shooting schedules and preparation for various roles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Did Jisoo, Ahn Bo Hyun Break Up?</h2><p>Ultimately, it was these demanding and conflicting schedules that led to the end of their brief romance.
