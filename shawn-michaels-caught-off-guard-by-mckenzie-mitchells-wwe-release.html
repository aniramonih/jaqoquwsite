That is what happened as McKenzie Mitchell was recently released from WWE. Now Shawn Michaels admitted that he did not even see the release coming.</p><p>McKenzie Mitchell, who appeared on-screen as a host for WWE on their various media outlets, and NXT, <a href=#>recently announced that she was let go from the company</a> but had nothing but positive things to say about them.</p><p>While speaking during the ongoing media call for the<a href=#> NXT Deadline Premium Live Event</a>, Shawn Michaels was asked about McKenzie Mitchell’s release. The Heartbreak Kid stated he lacked insights into the decision and was genuinely surprised and blindsided by it.</p><p>“No, I don’t. McKenzie is always going to be a part of the NXT family. It obviously took me by surprise as well, my understanding is that there are some areas where we have overlapping jobs and there were going to be changes.”</p><p>Despite acknowledging changes and overlapping roles, Michaels emphasized Mitchell’s perpetual connection to the NXT family. He then made it clear that the open door is always with WWE, expressing hope for a future return somewhere down the line. We will have to wait and see what the future holds for the former WWE host.</p><p>“There are a lot of things that go on in this company that are way above me, and this was obviously one of them. Like we always say, the door is always open in the WWE, I think that, in my opinion, McKenzie will always be a part of the NXT family and it doesn’t mean that we can’t revisit that relationship down the road. Obviously, it’s a loss to us in NXT, but the machine, as always, has to continue to roll on and we will obviously do that and miss her greatly because everybody absolutely loves and adores McKenzie.”</p><p>McKenzie Mitchell’s unexpected departure from WWE left even a legend like Shawn Michaels taken aback. As the NXT family bids farewell to a beloved member, it’s clear that the door to WWE remains open, leaving room for the possibility of a future reunion. While changes are inevitable in the world of sports entertainment, McKenzie Mitchell’s positive impact and warm reception within NXT will undoubtedly be missed.</p><p>What’s your opinion on what Shawn Michaels said?
