She is the former wife of <a href=#>Cee Lo Green</a> and one of the cast members of the VH1 reality television series, Atlanta Exes. The couple was married in 2000, but they were headed for trouble only one year later when the police were called to the house because of a domestic dispute. Cee Lo was charged with two misdemeanors – simple assault and disorderly conduct. The court mandated that Green attend domestic violence counseling and he was subjected to random drug and alcohol testing. While the couple clearly had their differences, the marriage was not all bad. Christina at times would describe her then-husband as a 'really good man with a kind heart.' Christina filed for divorce in May of 2004 citing "mental and physical cruelty" and noted that the couple had separated a year earlier. In August 2005 a settlement was reached and Cee Lo agreed to Christina's court request for joint legal and sole physical custody of their son, Kingston. Christina also has two older daughters from a previous relationship, Kalah and Sierra, and has one grandson, who is the son of her daughter Sierra.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356409 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Christina-Johnson-1.jpg alt width=900 height=824 sizes="(max-width: 1486px) 100vw, 1486px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356409 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Prince Williams/WireImage)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLCpvsisq6KmkWK3sLTNrKanZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
