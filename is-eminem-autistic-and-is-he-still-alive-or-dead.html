Born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, Eminem is still very much alive and he is 51 years old, he was born on 17 October 1972.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Eminem is one of the most successful and critically acclaimed rappers in history, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. His success has not shielded him from many rumors and claims tied to his name, one of which is the report that he is autistic. The belief is tied to his level of creativity among other things. In the same light, there have also been rumors of death surrounding the rapper.</p><h2><strong>Does Eminem Have Autism?</strong></h2><p>No, there is no outright evidence that Eminem has autism. However, people have held the belief for a very long time that he may actually have the condition due to his musical abilities, some things he says in his lyrics, and his general behavior.</p><p>As regards his lyrics, there are those who indicated that the rapper has spoken about being obsessed and repetitive, which may be a sign of Autism. He made this revelation in songs like Cleaning Out My Closet (2002) and Legacy (2013). In addition to that, there are claims that his lyrics have also suggested that he has Autism Spectrum Disorder&nbsp;(ASD) which he suggested in the lyrics of his song Legacy where he talked about his perceived developmental disabilities.</p><p>The general lifestyle of the rapper, such as his often awkward behavior, distinct style, and creativity, as well as his struggles with pill and drug addiction are some of the possible signs of autism.</p><p>Although the rapper has often discussed his general struggles, including with things such as anxiety, which has been linked to autism, he has never stated anything about being autistic.</p><p>More so, there is the argument that the rapper is not autistic because he has been able to maintain a great relationship with people close to him, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>including his kids</a>, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, and others in the music industry for decades. This is something that may be difficult for someone having the condition.</p><h2><strong>Is Eminem Dead or Still Alive?</strong></h2><p>Eminem is still alive and in good health. The legendary rapper has been a victim of celebrity dead hoax several times in the past, but he is still kicking well and strong.</p><p>The Loose Yourself rapper became a victim of a death hoax in August 2023 when there were reports that he passed away at the age of 50. But then, this did not trend very well before it was confirmed that there was no truth to the report, which began on social media.</p><p>Before then, there were other times when he was claimed to have died, including in December 2022 when a cruel hoax began on social media that he had lost his life. The same thing <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>happened in 2020</a> when someone on Twitter got the rap world confused with fake reports that he had lost his life.</p><p>Apart from the rapper, there are many other celebrities who have also been victims of death hoaxes in the past, including <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>50 Cent</a>, Beyoncé, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake.</p><h2><strong>Did Eminem Retire?</strong></h2><p>No, Eminem has not retired from music. Since he started his career fully in the 1990s, he has remained one of the most consistent musicians in the industry. He has made it known several times in the past that he feels like walking away from music, but he has still managed to remain.</p><p>Although he has taken some periodic breaks, he has still remained very relevant as a solo act and he has also collaborated with several others in the past. His most recent project is Curtain Call 2, which he released in August 2022. All through his career, the rapper has worked as a part of D12 and Bad Meets Evil.</p><p>While there are continuous rumors that the multi-Grammy-winning rapper may soon call it quits and retire, there is nothing that suggests it may happen any time soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLa0ecSmoKednWKutsDIrKuim12Wu6V5yKxkoZ1dqMGquMtmmKWhppp6sL6MnZyanF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
