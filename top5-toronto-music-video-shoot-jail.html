The ministry has launched a full investigation into this incident and appropriate action will be taken.”</p><p>It is not clear, however, what penalties Top5 may face as a result of his “unauthorized photography.”</p><p>Top5 is currently in jail after being accused of murdering 20-year-old Hashim Omar Hashi back in January 2021.</p><p>He went on the run from the authorities and evaded capture until February 2022, <a class=underline-link href=#>when he was arrested in California and subsequently deported back to Canada</a>.</p><p>The United States District Court for the Central District of California said Top5 identified as “a fugitive from the Government of Canada” and signed an affidavit of consent to extradition to his home country on December 9, 2021.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The rapper had been living it up in Los Angeles, California, promoting his new music after posting bail and cutting off an ankle monitor.</p><p>Courts confirmed Top5 was competent enough to “knowingly and voluntarily” give consent with a lawyer present.

The accounting student was mistaken for a person the shooters thought killed Top’s brother, Said Ali, also known as “Foolish.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-21-at-2.46.58-PM-e1621623553758-250x142.png alt="Toronto Drill Rapper Top5 Wanted For Murder" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Toronto Drill Rapper Top5 Wanted For Murder</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>May 21, 2021</p></a><p>“Ali subsequently discussed killing people in retaliation for his brother’s death on social media posts, including one less than three days before the murder,” court filings say.
