She is among the richest woman in the world.</p><p>Jacqueline Mars was born on <i>October 10, 1939,</i> in Pittsburgh, Massachusetts. She is among the three children born to&nbsp;<strong>Forrest Edward Mars Sr.&nbsp;</strong>and his wife, <strong>Audrey Ruth Mars</strong>. Her father was an American businessman, and the Mars candy empire's driving force and the mother worked at home. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1961 with a degree in anthropology.&nbsp;</p><h2>Relationship Status of Jacqueline Mars</h2><p>Many people think that money is the most significant asset and can gain anything they want through cash. However, Mars does not have such an opportunity in her life. She is not active in social media. Jacqueline seems to be living a happy life with her children.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/10/5b52355de121fe1a008b4986%20(1)-1599757406143.jpg><p>Mars spends her time working on the Washington National Opera board of directors, the National Sporting Library, and the Fine Arts Museum. More to that, She works for various organizations. She seems to be living a quality time with her children and grandchildren.</p><h2>Jacqueline Mars was Married Twice</h2><p>It is a matter of the fact that Jacqueline has been married twice to date. She was first married to her longtime boyfriend, <strong>David H. Badger</strong>, in 1961. They were in a romantic relationship for sometime before tying their wedding knot.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo had a private wedding ceremony. Only a few members from both the families and some close friends attended the ceremony. Both of them seemed to be very much supportive of each other. Soon after their wedding, the love birds welcomed their first child, <strong>Alexandra Badger</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/10/9b80292a9db11c27a0f7b7353a78a123%20(1)-1599757525390.jpg><p>The exact birth date is still under investigation. Then after the birth of Alexandra, they were blessed with another child, <strong>Stephen M. Badger</strong>. The family of four welcomed a new member, Christa M Badger, in 1975.&nbsp;</p><p>This happy looking relationship never remained the same after the birth of their children. The couple eventually broke up and moved on in 1984. After this heartbreak, She remained single for some time and then fell in love with <strong>Harold 'Hank' Vogel</strong> and tied her wedding knot in 1986.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/10/large_3289_356123%20(1)-1599757733792.jpg><p>like that of her first marriage, this also ended with divorce in 1994.
