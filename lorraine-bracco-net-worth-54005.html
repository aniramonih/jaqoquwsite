She is the daughter of Eileen (nÃ©e Molyneux 1926â€“2010) and Salvatore Bracco, Sr. She has a sister, <a href=#>Elizabeth Bracco</a>, and brother, Salvatore Jr. Her mother was from <a href=#>England</a> and met her <a href=#>Father</a> during World War II. Eileen came with Salvatore to the United States as a war bride. Bracco grew up in Westbury, on <a href=#>Maxwell</a> Drive on Long Island. She graduated from Hicksville High School in 1972. Her <a href=#>Father</a> was of <a href=#>Italian</a> descent, while her mother was born in <a href=#>England</a> to <a href=#>French</a> parents. Bracco is fluent in <a href=#>English</a>, <a href=#>French</a> and <a href=#>Italian</a>.</p><span>1974</span><p>In 1974, Bracco moved to <a href=#>France</a>, where she became a fashion model for Jean-Paul Gaultier. She lived there for about a decade.</p><span>1979</span><p>Bracco married Daniel Guerard in 1979, divorcing in 1982. They have one daughter, Margaux Guerard. She was in a 12-year relationship with actor Harvey Keitel, whom she met while living in Paris. They have one daughter, Stella Keitel (b. 1985). Bracco and Keitel fought a lengthy custody battle over Stella, resulting in Bracco's depression, a loss of acting roles, and $2 million in legal fees. She married Edward James Olmos in 1994, divorcing in 2002.</p><span>1980</span><p>During the 1980s, she also worked as a disc jockey for Radio <a href=#>Luxembourg</a>. She appeared as Paul Guilfoyle's hostage in the first season <i>Crime Story</i> episode, "Hide and Go Thief". Her sister Elizabeth played a hostage in the series pilot. Eventually, <a href=#>Italian</a> <a href=#>Director</a> and <a href=#>Novelist</a> Lina WertmÃ¼ller gave Bracco a small part in the film <i>Camorra</i>. "She dressed me up like an <a href=#>Italian</a> woman of no means. A street woman clad in disheveled clothes, hair unkempt and all that, and threw me on the set. She was so creative. I mean, Lina accentuated my eyes with dark make-up, the way Sophia Loren used to appear in those epic roles in the '60s. And talk about talent. She's so bright and perceptive. I mean, she's just fantastic. And yes, I learned a lot from her. She's a master of her profession, and I've been blessed not only with her, but also with so many masters," recounted Bracco to Daniel Simone during a 2007 interview. The experience inspired Bracco to pursue acting.</p><span>1999</span><p>During the audition process for <i>The Sopranos</i>, David Chase wanted her to read for the lead female role of Carmela <a href=#>Soprano</a>. However, Bracco had read the script and was drawn to the part of <a href=#>Psychiatrist</a> Dr. Jennifer Melfi. Bracco felt strongly enough about her ability and <a href=#>Desire</a> to play this part that she arranged a meeting with David Chase and talked him into letting her have a chance as Dr. Melfi. It netted her three consecutive nominations for Outstanding Lead <a href=#>Actress</a> in a Drama Series at the Emmy Awards in 1999, 2000 and 2001 and at the Golden Globe awards for Best TV <a href=#>Actress</a> in a Drama in 2000, 2001 and 2002. She lost out at the Emmys in 1999 and 2001 and at the Golden Globes in 2000 to her co-star Edie Falco. She was nominated again at the 2007 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting <a href=#>Actress</a> in a Drama Series, thus being pitted against <i>The Sopranos</i> co-star Aida Turturro for the award.</p><span>2006</span><p>Bracco is the owner of Bracco Wines, with association of Straight-Up Brands LLC. Her line of wines was featured on the Season 1 finale of Bravo's show <i>Top Chef</i> in 2006. She appeared as a guest judge for the two-episode finale. She also appeared as a special judge on <i>Top Chef: All Stars</i> in the episode titled "An Offer They Can't Refuse", which featured <a href=#>Italian</a> cuisine. Bracco appeared on a season 6 episode of <i>Throwdown! with Bobby Flay</i> as a guest judge for the ravioli throwdown.</p><span>2013</span><p>Bracco received her big career break when offered the role as the mobster-wife Karen Hill in <i>Goodfellas</i>, which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting <a href=#>Actress</a> and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting <a href=#>Actress</a> â€“ Motion Picture. She won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting <a href=#>Actress</a> and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting <a href=#>Actress</a>.</p><span>2015</span><p>Lorraine Bracco is a practitioner of Shotokan Karate.
