Once she dreamt of getting married to her fiancé Bob Kelty, but it couldn’t end as a reality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Likewise, she might have thought of making Costaki Economopoulos her husband as they have a young daughter together. Caroline gave birth to their daughter Ava Rhea Economopolous on Thursday, 23 October 2008. Costaki later married Christa Meola in December 2013.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Caroline had become pregnant with her first child at the age of 44. She revealed the experience of her conception which she achieved after so many years.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>The actress mentioned that she along with her then-boyfriend&nbsp;Costaki Economopoulos were trying hard to have a baby, but much of their attempts were becoming failures. On the other hand, Caroline was aging with each passing day, making the conception more complicated for her body.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Then, another tragedy struck the Canadian comedian. First Caroline's mother, Margery, got diagnosed with breast cancer and a week later, her father David was diagnosed with lung cancer. Caroline's mom survived for nearly six years; whereas, her dad died ten months after getting cancer.</p><p style=text-align:justify>A month after her father's death, Caroline succeeded in conceiving her daughter Ava, which made her believe that the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Today, Caroline is happily raising her daughter and the two are no less than best friends.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Caroline Rhea's daughter&nbsp;Ava Rhea Economopoulos in December 2018</strong> (Photo: Caroline Rhea's Instagram)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Caroline Rhea is the original host of NBC’s reality television show The Biggest Loser.
