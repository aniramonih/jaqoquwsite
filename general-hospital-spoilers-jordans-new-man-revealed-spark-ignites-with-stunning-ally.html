Many fans were excited at the prospect of Jordan and Zeke Robinson’s (Gavin Houston) messy romance, which was complicated in the soapiest way possible since Zeke is Portia Robinson’s (Brook Kerr) brother."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The latest 2024 preview info points to Jordan developing a spark with someone surprising, so this could lead to a fresh romance.</p><p>Many fans were excited at the prospect of Jordan and Zeke Robinson’s (Gavin Houston) messy romance, which was complicated in the soapiest way possible since Zeke is Portia Robinson’s (Brook Kerr) brother.</p><p>Unfortunately, the show dropped that romantic possibility – at least for now. Jordan is still single at the moment, but maybe not for much longer!</p><p>In the coming months, Jordan will keep up her efforts to figure out who opened fire on the Metro Court and put Curtis Ashford (Donnell Turner) in that wheelchair.</p><p>Curtis was planning on being a big part of that investigation, but now his attention is focused on his experimental treatment and the chance to walk again.</p><p>That means Jordan is going to need a little more help on the case – and she’ll end getting it from someone totally unexpected.</p><p>There’s going to be another key player in this storyline who becomes a shocking ally. Jordan will find an intriguing recruit, which will set the stage for a surprising spark to ignite between them.</p><p>Meanwhile, we’ve got other GH spoilers about Nikolas Cassadine’s (Adam Huss) return lighting a fuse and pulling the Ashfords into the situation.</p><p>When you add up all the clues here, it certainly sounds like Jordan and Nikolas might be paired up!</p><p>Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean that Nikolas and Jordan will be a true love match. It could be a situation where Jordan and Nikolas simply hook up once they’re in each other’s orbit.</p><p>Nikolas and Jordan may find that they have some magnetic chemistry, so that could lead to growing temptation and set the stage for them to surrender in bed.</p><p>Then again, maybe Jordan and Nikolas could have a legitimate love story depending on where GH writers want to go with these two.</p><p>Nikolas certainly doesn’t seem over Ava Jerome (Maura West) yet, so never say never on their reunion chances.</p><p>Even so, signs do point to Nikolas and Jordan’s spark pulling them closer, so it’s worth keeping an eye on that in the months ahead.</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say more romantic shockers could be in the works, so stick with us for updates on all the hot pairings and any other sizzling news.</p><p>CDL will have other terrific <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, news and updates to check out, so make us your go-to GH source.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaW1nl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aqqaeZobKzv4yjpquckaPAbrrEsGSmmZ5iv6bCxJqjnpxdqL2ivspmoKCmmamytHnWoquhZaOpwq%2B6yKeeZpmcocZw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
