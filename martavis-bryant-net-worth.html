According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Bryant’s net worth is as high as $4 million, an amount earned through his successful career, active since 2014.</p><h3>Martavis Bryant Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>Raised by a single mother who in order to support his education worked at a textile plant, in addition to school, Martavis was also a part of the Hargrave Military Academy, which in large measure helped him to mature. He first attended Calhoun Falls High School, but then in his senior year transferred to T.L. Hanna High School, located in Anderson, South Carolina. He played high school football for his new school, and with 70 receptions and 11 touchdowns from 722 yards, Martavis earned first-team all-state honors.</p><p>Even before finishing high school, he committed to Clemson University for 2011, following the completion of the Hargrave Military Academy. In his first season, he played against such future NFL players as Sammy Watkins, Jaron Brown, and DeAndre Hopkins, recording nine receptions from 220 yards for two touchdowns. He improved in the second season with a career-high 10 caught passes and four touchdowns, from 305 receiving yards. In 2013, Martavis had another extremely successful season, finishing with a career high seven touchdowns from 828 receiving yards and 42 receptions.</p><p>He then declared for the 2014 NFL Draft, deciding to forego his final year, and was chosen by the Steelers as the 118th overall pick, after successfully completing NFL Combine drills. He signed his rookie contract with Pittsburgh on the 9th June 2014, worth $2.659 million over four years, with $439,220 guaranteed, and an additional $439,220 signing bonus, which certainly established his net worth.</p><p>Martavis didn’t make his debut until week seven of the season due to an injury in the last season, but also because of the feel of <a href=#>Mike Tomlin</a>, head coach of the Steelers, that Martavis wasn’t the dominant force he was looking for. However, in his debut Martavis scored a touchdown, and until the end of the season started three times and played in 10 games, scoring eight touchdowns from 549 receiving yards and 26 catches.</p><p>2015 didn’t start rather well for Martavis since he missed the first four games because of a suspension by NFL, as it was discovered that he had violated the league’s substance abuse policy. Nevertheless, in his first game of the season, Bryant scored two touchdowns, one of 88 yards, and had a 10-catch game, against the Denver Broncos, in which he had 87 yards. He finished the season with 765 receiving yards from 50 receptions for six touchdowns.</p><p>The 2016 season wasn’t anywhere close to a start, but the young wide receiver was banned for its entirety, as he had again violated the league’s substance abuse policy.</p><p>Martavis returned for the 2017 season, and for the first time in his career played in the first game and as a starter – Bryant had 14 receiving yards in the victory against the Cleveland Browns. However, a few games into the season, he got into an argument with head coach <a href=#>Mike Tomlin</a>, and as a result Martavis was sent to the scout team. He even wanted to be traded, but the front office didn’t have such plans, and he was brought back into the first team, playing in 15 games, but scoring only three touchdowns from 603 receiving yards.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, Martavis is in a relationship with Deja Hiott, with whom he has a son and two daughters.</p><p>Martavis is a big tattoo fan, and among many other inked symbols and words, he has the NFL shield logo on his abdomen which is his reminder that he was drafted only in the fourth round – according to him, this has kept him motivated.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=4><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>NBC Sunday Night Football</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Pittsburgh Steelers Wide Receiver</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>NFL Monday Night Football</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Pittsburgh Steelers Wide Receiver</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqaYq6yRq7a0ecGrsJqmpGK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
