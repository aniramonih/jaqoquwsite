He attended Utah State University in 1937 and became fascinated by Charles Manson. It sparked his desire to understand a violent mind and what would lead them to commit killer acts.</p><p id=par-3_58>Dr. Carlisle graduated with a BS and MS from Utah State University before earning a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Brigham Young University. &nbsp;Charlene Harmon, Dr. Carlisle’s daughter, explained that the term “serial killer” had not been invented while her father was in school. He was a clinical psychologist who got a job at the Utah State Prison.</p><p id=par-4_70>What some viewers may find surprising about him were his beliefs. So invested in uncovering what makes serial killers tick, Dr. Carlisle was a devout Mormon. According to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> TV Insider</a>, creative consultant for Dr. Carlisle, Carrie Anne Drazewski-Keller explained, “His belief system is that everyone is born good and is always good people, but that good people do bad things. That’s what he told me. He needed to understand why.”</p><p id=par-5_51>His beliefs and inquisitive mind led his work at the Utah State Prison to come face to face with what would be some of America’s worst killers in history. Violent Minds: Killers on Tape helps explore how Dr. Carlisle became integral to the justice system and future study of these offenders.</p><h2>‘Violent Minds: Killers on Tape’ explores Dr. Carlisle’s 90-Day evaluation work at the prison</h2><p id=par-6_44>Everything fans see in Netflix’s Mindhunter is only part of the story of the state’s attempts to understand serial killers. Before the BSU, Dr. Carlisle became integral to helping the justice system. He helped determine whether an offender deserved a lengthy prison sentence.</p><p id=par-7_68>Violent Minds: Killers on Tape uses a 2017 interview with Dr. Carlisle, where he explains how his path got started. In 1967, after graduation, he began working at the prison. He and Dr. Allan Roe were the only two psychologists at the facility. But Roe explained they had to start the department from scratch because “no one knew what we were supposed to do or what psychologists did.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2><p lang=en dir=ltr>In the new series <a href=#>#ViolentMinds</a>, Dr. Carlisle reveals the shocking admissions he learned from speaking to some of America’s most notorious killers.

He explained he was a part of the state’s “90-Day Evaluation Program.” His task was to evaluate inmates sent to the program by the state. Why? To conclude whether or not an inmate is prone to violent offenses or future crimes. Inmates were often sent to Dr. Carlisle if a judge was uncertain how to sentence an offender, either send them to jail or probation.</p><p id=par-9_49>In March 1976, Violent Minds: Killers on Tape details Dr. Carlisle’s first meeting with none other than Ted Bundy. His time with Bundy was before Utah knew of his crimes and his infamy as a serial killer. Bundy would be Dr. Carlisle’s most prolific study but not his last.</p><h2>Where is Dr. Carlisle now?</h2><p id=par-10_51>Ted Bundy is inarguably <a href=#>part of America’s horrid history with serial killers</a>. Violent Minds: Killers on Tape explored how Dr. Carlisle got into his mind to understand if Bundy indeed was evil or where his murderous tendencies stemmed from. But Dr. Carlisle was only at the start of Bundy’s story.</p><p id=par-11_60>His evaluation of Bundy allowed Americans to be free of his murderous ways for over 10 years, as he was sentenced to prison based on Dr. Carlisle’s report. After Bundy, Dr. Carlisle also studied Arthur Gary Bishop, who killed five young boys and more. Through his work, one of his areas of expertise, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oxygen</a>, was dissociative identity disorder.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>In the series premiere of <a href=#>#ViolentMinds</a>, Dr. Carlisle is asked to run a psychological evaluation on a man who would become one of America’s most notorious killers.
