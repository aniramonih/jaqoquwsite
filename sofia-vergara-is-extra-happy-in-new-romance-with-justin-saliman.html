“Sofía is falling for Justin the more she spends time with him,” a source exclusively tells Us Weekly. “They have amazing chemistry, and her friends think they make a wonderful couple.”
Noting that Vergara, 51, “is always a positive person,” the insider stated that her inner circle thinks “she seems extra happy since she’s been seeing Justin."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He has his own thing going on and seems to really like her for her.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Modern Family</a> alum first sparked romance rumors with Saliman, 49, last month when they were spotted having dinner together in Beverly Hills. “Although Sofía has been dating Justin for a short while, they’ve gotten fairly close over the past several weeks,” a second insider told <a href=#>Us</a> at the time. “The attraction is there and he’s definitely her type.”</p><p>According to the insider, the couple have “run in similar circles” for years. “Sofía is attracted to his sense of humor and his intelligence,” the source continued. “Plus, he’s a total gentleman and treats her with nothing but respect. She’s excited to see where things go.”</p><p>Vergara’s romance with Saliman marks her first since she and Manganiello, 46, <a href=#>split after 7 years of marriage</a> in July. “We have made the difficult decision to divorce,” the exes said in a joint statement. “As two people that love and care for one another very much, we politely ask for respect of our privacy at this time as we navigate this new phase of our lives.”</p><p><a href=#>Divorce docs filed by Manganiello</a> days later listed their official date of separation as July 2, 2023. A third source revealed that the duo were <a href=#>“rarely on the same page”</a> and were “living different lives” prior to their split as Vergara is “very social” and Manganiello is “more of a homebody.”</p><p>In addition to working out the <a href=#>custody of their shared dog</a>, Bubbles, Vergara asked the court to <a href=#>enforce her and Manganiello’s prenup agreement</a> in court docs obtained by Us in August. Per the agreement, Vergara is asking that items such as artwork, jewelry and “other personal effects” remain under her possession and is looking to claim earnings from before and after the pair’s relationship as assets.</p><p>Manganiello, for his part, has also seemingly moved on from his former partner. He was <a href=#>spotted working out</a> with actress and model <strong>Caitlin O’Connor</strong> in September, after which the pair drove off together in a Cadillac SUV.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Vergara followed up her ex’s outing by <a href=#>posting a cheeky throwback pic</a> of herself via her Instagram Story. “Colombia,” the <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> judge captioned a pic of herself sporting a thong bikini bottom with a bouquet covering her chest on September 14. The post also featured a “#TBT” sticker.</p><p>With reporting by Sarah Jones</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp5aerm7CxKuemqqRYra0ecSxq6uZXZ2usbzYZqCnZZ6axG6%2BzqaYp5uVYsSqwMdmoa6rpJ67br%2FApaCmmZ5k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
