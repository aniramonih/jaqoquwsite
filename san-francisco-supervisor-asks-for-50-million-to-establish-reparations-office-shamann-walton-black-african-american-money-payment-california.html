"As the final report will be received very soon, to set up an office of reparations, which is already a recommendation."<p>Walton said the office would establish a database that would be used for the vetting process, and that the work would begin "almost immediately upon approval."</p><p>The city supervisor also said that he is requesting legislation from the San Francisco City Attorney's Office to create the Office of Reparations housed under his city's Human Rights Commission.</p>It is time for us to prove that we support repairing the harm that has created so many negative outcomes and wealth disparities for Black people in this city, by design!"

Even the San Francisco chapter of the NAACP rejected the proposal, arguing reparations should be made in the form of investments and opportunities, not cash payments.</p>We strongly believe that creating and funding programs that can improve the lives of those who have been impacted by racism and discrimination is the best path forward toward equality and justice," San Francisco NAACP President Amos Brown <a href=# title="https://twitter.com/NAACPSF1/status/1635830106299174915?s=20" class=themeColorForLinks>said in a statement.</a><p>Polling also shows that a majority of Americans don’t support reparations.
