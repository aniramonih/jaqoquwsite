The acclaimed media personality has certainly come a long way from her career beginnings as a reporter for a news blog.</strong></p><p>Kaitlan Collins routinely covers American presidents both at home and abroad. She has also made history as the youngest Chief White House correspondent for CNN. Though her career has not been without controversies, Collins wouldn’t have it any other way as she remains committed to being diligent, fair, right, and reaching the people in her chosen path.</p><h2><strong>Kaitlan Collins is an Alumna of the University of Alabama</strong></h2><p>Kaitlan Collins is now one of the rising stars in broadcast journalism, but she never aspired to become a journalist. In fact, nothing in her heritage pointed to the fact that she would one day shape the political discourse in America. While growing up in Prattville, Alabama, Collins had an apolitical upbringing. She and her three siblings never <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>experienced</a> their parents talking about politics or presidential candidates.</p><p>Their parents also never voted, and the only news that the family watched was The Today Show. So, what led Kaitlan Collins to journalism? She initially enrolled as a chemistry major during her college days at Alabama University. However, she struggled to keep up and decided to switch tracks. The young girl recalled her love for writing and reading and decided to pursue a political science and journalism degree.</p><h2><strong>Kaitlan Collins’s Salary Was </strong><strong>About $30,333 – $74,837 Per Annum After&nbsp;</strong><strong>Commencing Her Career as a Reporter</strong></h2><p>Kaitlan Collins began her journalism career by interning as an entertainment reporter for a local paper during her college days. Upon completing her college degree around 2014, she headed out to Washington D.C., where she landed her first proper job as an entertainment reporter for The Daily Caller. The Daily Caller is right-wing news and opinion website, and Collins spent about two years covering the entertainment bit for them.</p><p>She subsequently switched tracks to politics during the 2016 presidential election and extensively covered Trump’s campaign for office. When Trump eventually emerged victoriously, The Daily Caller knew that there was no better person to cover his time in the house than Kaitlan Collins. Therefore, they named her their Chief White House Correspondent in January 2017 and started covering the Trump administration.</p><p>She did this for about six months before CNN eventually hired her&nbsp;in July 2017. Kaitlan Collins’ salary during her days at The Daily Caller is not available, but it is estimated that she may have possibly earned as much as $30,333 – $74,837 per annum.</p><h2><strong>Kaitlan Collins’s CNN Salary is About </strong><strong>$100K Per Annum After Becoming </strong><strong>White House Correspondent in July 2017</strong></h2><p>Upon joining CNN in July 2017, Kaitlan Collins was asked to join their White House team of correspondents. This was during the era of the Trump presidency, and she got to cover every bit of activity that the president embarked upon both at home and abroad. She also attended several press briefings. Collins’ brilliance and excellence shone through in each report she filed in, and her profile rose. Her work was not without its challenges, as she butted heads with the former president on several occasions.</p><p>Trump believed that CNN was against him, which made him antagonize their correspondents, one of whom was Collins. He ignored her question about his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2018. He then subsequently <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">banned</a> her from an event in the Rose Garden. This ban was resisted by CNN and even other networks such as Fox News. On her part, Collins refused to be cowered for the remainder of the administration.</p><p>She continued asking the president tough questions on issues such as his Covid-19 response. She also maintained her composure during several infuriating incidents. For instance, in April 2020, she was asked to leave the front row of seats and exchange with another reporter in the back row, but they both refused to comply. In November 2020, she indicated she wanted to ask the White House Press Secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, questions.</p><p>Still, McEnany refused to call on her, stating that she doesn’t call on ‘activists.’&nbsp;This remained the pattern of Collins’s relationship with the Trump administration, but she wasn’t perturbed as she knew she was getting more experience for the journey ahead. Her employers also compensated her quite well, and she earned an estimated $100,000 per annum.</p><h3><strong>She Made History as the Youngest CNN Chief White House Correspondent in January 2021</strong></h3><p>Kaitlan Collins spent the remainder of the Trump presidency covering his administration and the presidential election of 2020. She gave a good account of herself, and by the time that Joe Biden was sworn in as president in January 2021, she was appointed the CNN Chief White House Correspondent. She achieved this feat at the age of 28, making her the youngest person to attain that position.</p><p>Kaitlan Collins remains the CNN Chief White House Correspondent to date and reportedly earns about $169,000 per annum. She has covered the president at both home and abroad. Her stint with the Biden White House has been relatively controversy-free, but the president did<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external> snap</a> at her following a question about his statement at a summit in Geneva in June 2021. He subsequently apologized, but she waved it off as not necessary.<br></p><h3><strong>Kaitlan Collins Career History and Salaries&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li>Entertainment reporter at The Daily Caller – 2014 to January 2017 ($30,333 – $74,837 per annum est.)</li><li>White House correspondent at The Daily Caller – January 2017 to July 2017 ($30,333 – $74,837 per annum est.)</li><li>CNN White House Correspondent July 2017 to January 2021 ($100,000 per annum est.)</li><li>CNN Chief White House Correspondent – January 2021 to date ($169,000 per annum est.)</li></ul><h2><strong>Kaitlan Collins’s </strong><strong>Net Worth is about $5 Million Since Becoming </strong><strong>CNN Chief White House Correspondent</strong></h2><p>Kaitlan Collins now has a net worth of $5 million, though some sources estimate it could be as high as $5 million.
