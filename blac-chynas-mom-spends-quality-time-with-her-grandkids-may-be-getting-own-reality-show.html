Tokyo shared a video clip of her painting with Dream Kardashian and King Cairo a few days ago. In the clip, the proud grandma celebrates the fact that her granddaughter knows her colors. In fact, Dreamy knows her mom’s favorite color."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

How cute is that?</p><p></p><p>Tokyo Toni, real name Shalanta Hunter, made her mark on Blac Chyna’s reality show, The Real Blac Chyna, on the first episode of the series. Many were shocked to learn of the mother-daughter dynamic, which has its share of challenges. Everything especially came to a head during the first episode when Shalanta exploded on Blac Chyna. Hunter accused her daughter of taking away her car. Chyna refuted such an accusation.</p><p></p><p>“I feel bad for Chyna because her mom is ridiculous and dramatic as hell,” one YouTube viewer shared. “The scene with her mom was disturbing to watch,” one Blac Chyna fan concluded.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1nFrKjjjWq/</p><p>It may have been disturbing to see Shalanta and Blac Chyna at each other’s throats, but the result of such tension has been beautiful. Tokyo Toni traveled to Atlanta to support her daughter after the fallout in Los Angeles. The celebrity’s mom has also been filmed while spending more time at home with Blac Chyna. Positive vibes appear to be on the rise!</p><p>Some say that Tokyo Toni would do well to have a Reality TV series of her own. Blac Chyna’s mother is, after all, a hilarious personality on her daughter’s show.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B19OWy6DV_X/</p><p><strong>BCK Asks:</strong> How would you feel about Tokyo Toni getting her own reality series?
