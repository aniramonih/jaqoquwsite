We were married for 14 years. There are some things we talked about that were personal to us.</p><p>He further added&nbsp;</p><p>"I hope the film (Houston's film Whitney) expresses what I think is the truth… that they were romantically involved. As a teen, Whitney ran from her mother’s house into the arms of Robyn.”</p><p>Brown's interview with US Weekly has magnified the speculation about Houston bisexuality and relationship with Robyn by ten folds.&nbsp;</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary&nbsp;</h2><p>Ever since the death of her rumored partner or friend Whitney Houston's death, Robyn has remained very low-key about her personal life, so the details about her earning are out of media's reach.
