She was cremated and shares a niche in a columbarium with Troup, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills. After their deaths, the couple's Encino home was sold for close to its last asking price of $1.9 million. The Colonial-style home was designed for London in 1959 by the late architect Paul Williams, who incorporated four 19th-century marble fireplaces into the design. London had purchased the fireplaces in France.</p><p>She began smoking in 1942, aged 15 or 16, and continued until 1995, when she suffered a debilitating stroke. In her biography, "Go Slow", she noted that the years of smoking and drinking had taken their toll. She remained in ill health. She was the only Emergency!

(1972) co-star), <a href=#>Bobby Troup</a>, on 22 February 1999, her poor health prevented her from speaking. The last few years of her life were plagued by accidents and ill health. Even before her stroke, she had several accidents, resulting in her breaking her hips. She spent most of her time in a wheelchair. She died on October 18, 2000, aged 74, having directed that no funeral or memorial service be held.</p><p>Along with <a href=#>Veronica Lake</a>, Rita Hayworth, and Lauren Bacall, she was reportedly one of the four key inspirations for the femme fatale character of Jessica Rabbit in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988).</p><p>Attended the funeral of ex-husband and former boss <a href=#>Jack Webb</a> in 1982.</p><p>Best remembered by the public (as an actress) for her starring role as head nurse Dixie McCall on Emergency!

Forced to give up band singing when her true age was discovered, she was primarily a torch singer. Her vocal range was described by "sultry" and "low-keyed". Her own favorite singers were Barbra Streisand and Roberta Flack. She was known in some circles as "The Liberty Girl" for helping establish Liberty Records, where she began singing in 1955, as a successful label. Her many hit albums on that label include "Julie Is Her Name", "Calendar Girl" with some borderline erotic (for the time) cover photography by Gene Lester, "About the Blues", "Your Number, Please", "Send For Me", "Love Letters", "The End of the World", "In Person at the Americana", "The Wonderful World of Julie London" and the provocatively titled "Nice Girls Don't Stay for Breakfast".

She was eight years Troup's junior.</p><p>When she was getting a divorce from <a href=#>Jack Webb</a>, she agreed, then went to court. The judge granted the divorce and approved the property settlement agreement, under which Webb had paid his wife $150,000 in cash, gave her $150,000 in securities of his production company, $21,000 a year for herself and for the couple's two children, Stacy and Lisa. Webb also agreed to take out a $150,000 insurance policy to guarantee alimony payments in case of his death. In addition, she got a new Cadillac, jewelry and furnishings.

They had a radio show on which their daughter would sometimes appear. When she was a little girl she spent her summers with her aunt Ethel and her family on picnics and vacations to the mountains above San Bernardino or at one of the beach towns along the California coast. In 1938, when she was only 11, her father, Jack Peck, an alcoholic, was arrested for reckless driving. Later, the Pecks ran a photography business in San Bernardino, California, until it went bankrupt in 1941, when Julie was 14. The family then moved to Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfn8KttcRmo6imlKS7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
