He is <strong>69 years old</strong>.</p><h2>Steve Gregg Height</h2><p>He is a man of above-average stature. Gregg stands at a height of <strong>5 ft 11 in</strong> (Approx. 1.78 m).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/factsbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Steve-Gregg-1.jpg><h2>Steve Gregg Family</h2><p>Gregg was born and brought up in Southern California, in the United States to his parents. Gregg was brought up by parents who were true Christians, and who succeeded in imparting their faith to their three children. He has an older sister and a younger brother. Both his sister and brother are also currently serving in ministering the word of God. When Gregg was sixteen (1970), his family moved from Covina, California, to Orange County.</p><p>Gregg had lived in Covina for as long as he could remember, and he resisted moving away from his friends and familiar surroundings. Gregg’s sister had started playing in an all-girl, secular rock band (we had never heard of Christian rock at that time), as well as hanging out with guys who were long-haired musicians, just as the hippie movement was at its height.</p><h2>Steve Gregg Wife</h2><p>Gregg has married and divorced several times. For example, Steve was in a relationship in 1972 at the age of 19 when he fell in love with a girl in the Jesus Movement who had been converted from an alcohol-abusing, promiscuous, hippie background. The girl divorced Gregg leaving him with one child.</p><p>Six years following the divorce (1980), when Gregg was 27, she met and finally married a very like-minded and devout Christian girl, named <strong>June</strong>. June was taken the same year in a roadside accident (more detail on that, below). In the six months that the two were married, prior to June’s death, June’s remarkably virtuous life proved to Gregg that women can be as good as they can be bad. As Gregg was married to June, their family had become close friends with the parents of<strong> “K—”</strong>, who would afterward become his third wife!). “K—”’s parents were enthusiastic, regular attenders at a Bible study that Gregg was teaching every weekday morning in a restaurant in Santa Cruz, California.</p><p>Gregg and “K—” married and, subsequently, had four wonderful children —two sons and two daughters. About four months of “K—’s” departure, “K—” had divorced Gregg and resumed her pre-conversion lifestyle, living essentially as if she had never known Christ or been married. In January 2012, Gregg married <strong>Dayna</strong>, who had also suffered the loss of a 26-year marriage, due to a spouse who left to pursue other relationships and a different lifestyle. Dayna had raised two sons.</p><h2>Steve Gregg Education</h2><p>When Gregg attended freshman in high school, he had already concluded that he wanted to preach the gospel. Nothing else seemed more important to him than helping to direct lost people toward heaven. On occasion, Gregg went “witnessing” door-to-door, and evangelized friends at his high school. He became chosen by his friends to lead the youth group at the Baptist church that they attended. Gregg took speech classes so that he would have the opportunity to preach sermons to the others in the class. He had given a speech in junior high against evolution and took every opportunity he could to improve his information and to give that talk wherever he had an opening given to him.</p><h2>Steve Gregg The Narrow Path</h2><p>The Narrow Path is the radio and internet ministry of Steve Gregg, who works as a servant Bible teacher to the body of Christ.
