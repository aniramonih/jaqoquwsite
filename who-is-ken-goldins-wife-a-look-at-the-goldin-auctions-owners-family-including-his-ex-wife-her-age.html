However, reports suggest he has been married twice and has 3 children: one from his ex-wife and 2 from his current partner.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>King of Collectibles: The Goldin Touch</strong> is a new <strong>Netflix</strong> show that highlights the life of <strong>Ken Goldin</strong>, the founder and executive chairman of Goldin Auctions, a leading auction house that specializes in rare collectibles. The show premiered on 28 April on the streaming platform and has gathered a lot of attention ever since.</p><p>Goldin manages the thrilling auctions of priceless sports memorabilia, such as game-used jerseys and rare baseball cards, with a team of qualified specialists. The business has developed a reputation for its creative approach to auctions, which includes allowing online bidding. For both collectors and fans, Goldin and his crew are committed to offering an exciting and open auction experience.</p><p>With the increasing popularity of both the show and Ken Goldin himself, many people have been interested in his personal, including his marital life. Well, here’s everything you need to know about his wife and family.</p><p>Previously, we touched on <strong>Alex Giaimo</strong>, <strong>Jim Taubenfeld’s Net Worth</strong>, and <strong>Ken Goldin’s net worth</strong>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ken-goldins-wife-from-what-we-can-see-on-his-instagram-it-appears-ken-goldin-has-been-married-twice></span>Ken Goldin’s Wife: From What We Can See on His Instagram, It Appears Ken Goldin Has Been Married Twice!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There’s a reason why<strong> Ken Goldin</strong> (@kengoldin) keeps the identity of his wife private. According to what we can see on his Instagram, the King of Collectibles star has been married twice. Yes, you read it right. While his eldest <strong>daughter</strong>, <strong>Laura</strong> (@laurgoldin), is the only child from his previous marriage to his ex-wife, he also has a daughter and a son from his second marriage. He frequently posts pictures of all of his 3 children on his Instagram.</p><p>While some reports claim that the name of his wife is<strong> Jennifer Goldin</strong>, we have yet to confirm any information about her. Similarly, we also do not have any information about his wife’s age. After all, Ken has never ever mentioned or revealed anything about his marital status.</p><p>On the other hand, we do have a little information about his first marriage. Gossip Next Door claims that he and his first wife got married in 1994. However, the couple got divorced later. Additionally, Laura has posted her mother’s picture in one of her Instagram posts.</p><p>Even though he has been married twice, we can clearly see how much he enjoys spending time with his 3 children. In fact, Laura gets along with her step-siblings very well, as seen on Ken’s Instagram.</p><p>However, we do have to note that the given information is solely based on our speculation. We might be wrong about some information. Nonetheless, we promise we’ll get back to you as soon as we get any further information about his wife or family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-king-of-collectibles-filmed></span>Where Is King of Collectibles Filmed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Netflix’s King of Collectibles: The Goldin Touch is filmed in and around Runnemede, New Jersey. It only makes sense for the production crew to base itself in New Jersey given that <strong>Ken Goldin</strong> lives and works there. In addition, New Jersey is the location of several corporate headquarters, including 24 Fortune 500 firms.</p><p>The majority of the show&nbsp;was filmed in the Camden County, New Jersey, borough of Runnemede. The principal filming location for the reality series is the Goldin Auctions Headquarters in Runnemede, located at 160 East 9th Avenue, suite C. It was founded in 2012 by Ken Goldin and is the top marketplace for collectibles.</p><p>It also serves as the official auction partner for the Jackie Robinson Foundation, the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.</p><p>Additionally, the areas near the Runnemede headquarters of Goldin Auctions are frequently mentioned in the series. Several roads pass through the borough, including Route 168, Route 41, also known as the North-South Freeway or Route 41, and the New Jersey Turnpike, which is regarded as the busiest road in the area. As a result, it’s possible to recognize any of these in the scenery of the show’s outdoor scenes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yknKdll6S5pbXNrGSwoZaaeqJ5y6impGWRqXq1tMRmnqiklJ67bq3UnKuip56oerDDzZ6prGWWlrqquNhmoKebnKqxqrrGZp%2Biq12axW7DyJ%2BcZqCVp3qis8Ro</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
