She was married to <a href=#><strong>Paul Adelstein</strong></a> for nearly 10 years. In addition to both appearing on <a href=#><strong>Shonda Rhimes</strong></a>’ Scandal, Adelstein was a series regular on Grey’s Anatomy spinoff Private Practice. The former spouses, who wed in 2006 and separated in 2016, finalized their divorce in November 2017. They share daughter Josephine, born in 2010.</p><p>Weber, for his part, confirmed in 2016 that he has a daughter. “I’m trying to keep her my baby for as long as I possibly can. She’s still my little angel,” he said on The Steve Harvey Show in 2015. “We’ll see how long that lasts, but right now all is well.”</p><p>He also revealed during the same interview that he proposed to then-girlfriend <strong>Giselle</strong> after he filmed the pilot for HTGAWM in 2014.</p><p>“After we shot the pilot in Philadelphia, I came home and proposed to my girlfriend. I did it,” he told <a href=#><strong>Steve Harvey</strong></a> ahead of the 2015 wedding. “We’ve been engaged for just under a year, and I’m taking her to Bora Bora.”</p><p>The twosome split in 2016 after less than one year of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences in the divorce docs.</p><p>While Weil and Weber found love after their respective divorces, he revealed in 2019 that they had called it quits.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Liza and I share an amazing relationship rooted in love and respect. That relationship has found its way back to the great friendship we’ve always had,” Weber said in a statement in February 2019. “We will continue to support each other and will always love working together.”</p><p>Three years later, however, they are seemingly back on.
