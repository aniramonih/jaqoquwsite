I’ll have live coverage here on the website and will post my TNA Hitlist tomorrow morning. I will also debut a WWE Smackdown Hitlist on Saturday morning. You're not still reading this are you? Yeah, I had a hunch the headline of the article would make you skip this paragraph. The story would be way hotter if the female friend were claiming she had an affair with Brooke. Yeah, that's what the National Enquirer should have gone with. I think we all know the tabloid king would never make up a story, but I think there's a 50-50 chance seeing a similar story on the cover next week.</p><p>-A woman claims she had an affair with <b>Hulk Hogan</b> in the latest edition of The National Enquirer. Oh, and the woman is a 33 year-old friend of <b>Brooke Hogan</b>. “My relationship with Terry began at a time when Terry and Linda privately knew their marriage was ending,” Christiane Plante tells the Enquirer. “She had left him already, although no official papers had been filed... It seemed right then, but I knew it was wrong. Having felt the guilt and pain build up, I gave a note to Brooke apologizing for my actions. I will never be able to fully forgive myself for this. I have lost an amazing friend.” To read the full story, check out <a href=#>Popcrunch.com</a></p><p>-Today's poll question: Are you happy with the Money in the Bank match or would you rather see the wrestlers involved work singles matches at WrestleMania 24?</p><p>-57 percent of the readers who took part in our poll yesterday feel pro boxing is hurt more than pro wrestling by the popularity of UFC/MMA. Meanwhile, 21 percent of you felt that pro wrestling is hurt more by UFC, while 21 percent felt that neither sport is truly hurt by the competition. I was a casual boxing fan in the sense that I would tune in for HBO fights and order some of the bigger pay-per-view events in past years. UFC is responsible for stealing my attention to some extent, although suffering through so many lame decisions and lousy heavyweight boxing bouts also took their toll. Thanks again to Dot Net reader Jagger K. for submitting that question.</p><p>-Speaking of MMA, <a href=#>MMAjunkie.com</a> is reporting that Elite Xtreme Combat—not UFC—will end up being the first mixed martial arts company to appear on network television after striking a deal with CBS.</p><p><b><u>Daily Nuggets</u></b></p><p>Life goes on for Ohio Valley Wrestling despite the fact that they are no longer a WWE developmental territory.
