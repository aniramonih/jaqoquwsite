While Gleeson was heaped with praise for his portrayal of previous roles, in HBO’s ‘Run’ as Billy Johnson, he has managed to drop jaws and have fans drooling over his irresistible character, who never shies away from exploring his sexuality."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Not only has he stayed clear of rumors surrounding his romantic life, but also quite frankly expressed his dislike in the idea of being associated with another human being.</p><p>Besides posing alongside Gigi Hadid for the fall edition of Vogue magazine in 2016, the only other lady that he’s been spotted with is television producer Juliette Bonass. Upon witnessing the duo stroll about and attend film festivals together, fans were convinced that they were a thing, despite both the involved parties remaining tight-lipped.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the actor in his latest interview Washington Post has provided much-needed clarity on his alleged romantic relationship with Bonass.&nbsp;</p><p>“I find it strange that people want to know about those aspects of my life. And then I also find it odd that I’m quite so defensive about it. I think I hate the notion of anybody being defined by anybody else, and that seems to be what happens when anybody who happens to be in the public eye goes out with anybody else. Some things are precious. Why on earth would you share them?” Gleeson said.</p><p>What does his statement ultimately imply?&nbsp;</p><p>While Gleeson neither confirms or rejects the thought of him dating someone, he has made it quite clear that he wouldn’t want to talk about it. Perhaps, not even time or inside sources, but only Gleeson could tell us if he’s dating anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s expected to be next seen in ‘Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway’, the sequel to 2018 film ‘Peter Rabbit’, in which he has essayed the role of Thomas McGregor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJ2mpqCelrmtecalnJ6rn6N6pa3ToqWgZZykw6Z5y6KdnmWfm3qzwc1mmJysn6d6tMDEmqOippditaat0a2qZpqZobm6ecmon6ern6N6q8HLopytrJVir7C6wKyq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
