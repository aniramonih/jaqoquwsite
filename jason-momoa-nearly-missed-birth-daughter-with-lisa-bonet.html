When "The Cosby Show" actor Lisa Bonet was pregnant with their daughter, Lola Momoa, the "Dune" actor told <a href=#>Esquire</a> that he was all the way in Canada filming the sci-fi drama series "Stargate Atlantis." Weeks before her expected due date, Jason recounted to the publication how he woke up to about "70 calls" that Bonet had gone into labor. He was able to clinch a plane ticket for the last seat on a flight in the hopes of making it to Bonet and his soon-to-be-newborn daughter on time.</p><p dir=ltr>"I'm running through the airport, and I get in the car. I go, like, 'Dude, I don't care, run all the lights, I'll pay for everything,'" Jason recalled when he landed in Bonet's city. "And I made it in the nick of time. I had about two hours with [Bonet] in the tub, and my baby girl was born."</p><p dir=ltr>The "Aquaman" actor was ultimately able to make it in the end, and it seems like fatherhood has remained his top priority in life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamppaYV2gI6jmKynnmK6sLnOmmSnnZGnubp5zKKqrJ2UYq%2BqvtOhZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZq6irJhiuaq%2FwGaZqKaVqXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
