She says that she believes in living a balanced life. "I take great care of myself. Right now on vacation zero, I took care of myself," she admitted. "Tomorrow I start (going) to the gym because I ate pasta, crepes, macaroni, everything I wanted to eat; It's a balance, it's being good with you, I try to take care of myself when I'm not on vacation, I'm super strict with the gym and food."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/GettyImages-1320384365.jpg><p><span>Being in the public eye, Castro has to deal with a lot of criticism. However, she said on Hoy that she ignores critics and focuses on the positive side of things. "You have to understand that it's not personal, that's what my career is about sometimes. I have always said, one thing is an opinion and another thing is aggression; I respect opinions and read them, and I try to throw away aggressions."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/GettyImages-1171231387.jpg><p><span>On her 25th birthday, Castro went to Disney. "Cheers to 25," she wrote. (This is roughly translated.) "They have been an adventure and I cannot be more grateful to life for so many beautiful things, so many friends that fill my soul, for the beautiful family I have. For all the good, bad, regular experiences that have made me the person I am today. For the love of my life @pbernotk ❤️ THANK YOU LIFE FOR SO MUCH! Happy, grateful and blessed❤️ THANKS to each of you who have congratulated me by writing here, calls or messages, each of you has a very important place in my life and of course in these 25 years🎂 Ready for 75 more years amen."</span></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Dr. Jonathan Finnoff</span></a><span>, a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>physical medicine and rehabilitation</span></a><span> specialist at the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center</span></a><span> says, according to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>, "to prevent some downhill ski injuries, you should identify any deficits you have in strength, flexibility or balance. Physical conditioning starts with endurance exercises, particularly aerobic, which prevents fatigue. Strength training in your leg muscles helps you maintain control and absorb shock. And balance exercises coordinate your muscles to protect your joints."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/GettyImages-1202196503.jpg><p><span>Castro is partners with Pablo Bernot, who is reported to be director of new projects at the Las Mañanitas hotel and restaurant business. He's also an athlete who competed in a triathalon recently. "I'm not going to deny you I was very nervous, never doubting you," wrote Castro about him. (This is a rough translation.) "On the contrary I knew how well you were going to do but that sea is quite complicated. When you came out of the water my soul came back (literally) I saw you so confident and so smiling that I could only shout your name and everyone would hear the baton you brought, then you grabbed the bike and left faster than I even thought I had time to take a picture of you. When I saw that you were already in the transition for the last stage (running) I began to feel that my heart was jumping out of seeing how incredible you were doing ❤️ But when I saw you cross the finish line my eyes filled with tears and I couldn't feel more than a lot of pride, respect and admiration for you love, for your discipline, your determination, your desire and above all your COURAGE, This you did requires a lot of courage and preparation. I love you and I'm so proud of you❤️ Congratulations my champion You Escaped From Alcatraz❤️"</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkrKeWnq5ur8Csq6unXZ67bq7ArZ%2BippdiwLa102afmqtdl7KiwdOina6kXZmuunnIp2SbmZOWuaK%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
