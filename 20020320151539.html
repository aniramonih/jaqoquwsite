Although the actor’s agent is still insisting no wedding has taken place, Roger’s son Geoffrey admitted: “He has got married.” After meeting up with his mother Luisa and sister Deborah on Tuesday to discuss the news Geoffrey said: “We support his happiness and if he is happy then I am happy. I did not go. There was no family there. He wanted to do it in a low-key way and went off and did it.” The young restaurateur added: “I can’t tell you what my mother thinks about it. You will have to ask her.”&nbsp;</p><p id=ehqSxfJI28 data-wc=99>While none of Roger’s showbiz friends were invited to the ceremony, which took place ten days ago, the actor has informed his closest circle. “Roger called me a couple of days ago to say he had got married to Kiki,” said Joan Collins at Liza Minelli’s wedding last weekend. Despite his secrecy, Roger wasn’t able to keep completely mum about the subject, however, and apparently made some light-hearted asides about matrimony at Joan’s own nuptials to Percy Gibson. “He was joking about it being a great time to get married and dropping heavy hints in hindsight,” said one guest.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecNNdLZs3l data-wc=37>Roger met Kiki, a former neighbour and family friend, while he was recuperating from prostate cancer. In 1994 he broke up with Luisa, his wife of 38 years, over the phone, offering no explanation for the split.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
